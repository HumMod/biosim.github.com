<p> HumMod model validation compares model predictions to trusted
data. We are using the term <i>validation</i> on this page to mean
both model validation and model verification.

<p>A significant challenge in model validation is finding suitable
validation data.

<p> Here is our idea of some of the properties of suitable data.

<ul>
<li><p> Data is obtained from humans or there is a highly reliable way
to scale animal data to human values. The reason for this is that
HumMod’s predicted values are typically for a middle-aged human male.

<li><p> Data includes a mean value (but single value will suffice).
The reason for this is that such a value is used directly in
calculating the fit metric that we use in model validation.

<li><p> The variance (standard deviation) in the data is reported or
can be inferred from the data source. The reason for this is that
this information is used to quantitate the span parameter in the
fit metric calculation.

<li><p> The experimental protocol is known. The reason for this is
that we must create a comparable simulation protocol before the
fit metric can be applied. Protocols such as exercise or going to
altitude can produce useful comparisons. Just resting quietly is
also a valid experimental protocol and the data can be compared to
HumMod’s steady-state values.
</ul>

<p> Please send us via E-mail your thoughts on suitable data to use
in HumMod model validation. Including references, especially PMID's,
and attaching relevant figures is always useful. Where appropriate,
we'll add the data to this Web site and give you proper
acknowledgement.
