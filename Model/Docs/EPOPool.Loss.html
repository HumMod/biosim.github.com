<p>EPOPool.Loss
<p>Definition
<p>Loss is defined as negative changes in mass of EPO and is <br>a function of EPO clearance.
<p>Overview
<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein <br>which increases red blood cell (RBC) <br>production in response to decreases in <br>tissue oxygenation. EPO stimulates the <br>production of proerythroblasts from <br>hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.<br>In adult humans, 90% of all erythropoietin<br>is formed in the kidneys. The cellular <br>site of production in the kidney are interstitial<br>renal cells in the inner cortex lying in immediate <br>proximity to the proximal tubules. The remainder<br>is formed in the liver. Although the exact liver cell<br>type involved has not been isolated, hepatocytes,<br>Kupffer cells and small interstitial cells are<br>all possibilities. The hepatic component of <br>erythropoietin production is small( 5 - 15%).<br><br>Although increased secretion of erythropoietin <br>occurs within minutes of a decrease in renal tissue <br>oxygenation ,it takes several days before there <br>is an increase in the red blood <br>cell concentration - this is the EPO delay.<br><br>Erslev, A.J.
