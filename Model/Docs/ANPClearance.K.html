<p>Overview
<p>ANP is eliminated from the circulation by almost every tissue<br>by a combination of receptor mediated binding, by uptake and<br>metabolism by target tissues and by degradation by enzymes,<br>notably endopeptidases, and excretion into non plasma fluids <br>such as urine. The majority of ANP clearance probably involves<br>a receptor-mediated endocytosis. Two main types of ANP-specific <br>receptors have been identified - guanylate-cyclase-linked receptors <br>and a receptor thought to have a clearance function. The latter <br>(the clearance ANP receptors) comprise the largest population of <br>receptors and they appear to serve as a powerful mechanism <br>to clear ANP from the circulaton. <br><br>The relative contributions of different organs to the extraction <br>of ANP clearance have been studied systematically in both <br>experimental animals and humans. The lungs, kidneys and liver <br>are all important for ANP clearance. <br><br>Review<br>Ruskoaho H. Atrial natriuretic peptide: synthesis, release<br>and metabolism.
