<p>Overview
<p>Pheochromocytomas are rare catecholamine-secreting tumors <br>derived from the chromaffin cells of the embryonic neural<br>crest. In 1912, the pathologist Ludwig Pick formulated the <br>term pheochromocytoma, which decribes the colorful reaction <br>of tumor cells in response to the addition of fixatives <br>containing chromic acid salts. <br>Ninety percent of tumors occur in the adrenal medulla; <br>the remainder are extrarenal and are known as secreting <br>paragangliomas. In most patients with pheochromocytomas, <br>plasma catecholamine concentrations are elevated. Unlike the <br>healthy adrenal medulla, however, pheochromocytomas are not <br>innervated, and catecholamine release is not precipitated by <br>neural stimulation.<br><br>Most pheochromocytomas secrete both norepinephrine and <br>epinephrine although norepinephrine predominates. Tumors <br>can be both only norepinephrine or epinephrine secreting, <br>although the latter is very rare. An increase in the production <br>of catecholamines causes symptoms which include hypertension, <br>severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. These <br>symptoms reflect the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine <br>on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.<br>Some pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamines intermittently<br>and cause paroxysmal hypertension; others cause sustained <br>hypertension by constantly secreting catecholamines.<br><br>Manger WM, Gifford Jr. RW.
