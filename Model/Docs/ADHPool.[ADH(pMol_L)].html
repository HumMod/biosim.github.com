<p>ADHPool.[ADH(pMol/L)]
<p>Definition
<p>[ADH(pMol/L)] is the plasma concentration of ADH <br>expressed in pMol/L.
<p>Overview
<p>Antidiuretic hormone(also known as vasopressin or AVP),a nonapeptide, <br>is synthesized in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular<br>and supraoptic nuclei and stored in the posterior lobe of the pituitary. <br>Its release is stimulated by increased osmolality and by reductions <br>in blood volume and blood pressure. Increased ADH secretion causes <br>increased fluid reabsorption by the kidneys, helping to restore blood <br>pressure, blood volume and osmolality toward normal. <br><br>When the osmolarity of the body fluids increases above normal,<br>the posterior pituitary gland secretes more ADH, which increases<br>the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water.<br>This allows large amounts of water to be reabsorbed and results <br>in increases in blood volume and decreases in urine volume.<br>An increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity causes special <br>nerve cells called osmoreceptor cells, located in the anterior <br>hypothalamus near the supraoptic nuclei, to shrink. This  shrinkage <br>causes the cells to send nerve signals to the supraoptic nuclei which<br>stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. A second<br>neuronal area important in controlling osmolarity and ADH secretion <br>is located along the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, <br>called the AV3V region. At the upper part of this region is a structure <br>called the subfornical organ, and at the inferior part is another structure <br>called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Between these two <br>organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has multiple nerve connections<br>with the two organs as well as with the supraoptic nuclei and the blood <br>pressure control centers in the medulla of the brain. <br><br>ADH release is also controlled by cardiovascular reflexes in response to<br>decreases in blood pressure and/or blood volume including the arterial<br>baroreceptor reflexes and the cardiopulmonary reflexes. <br><br>Kurtzman NA, Boonjarern S.
