<p>HgbConc.[Total]
<p>Definition
<p>[Total] is the calculated hemoglobin concentration.<br>If the clamp is on, then [Total] is the level set by<br>the model user. Otherwise [Total] = [Basic]*HctEffect.<br>HctEffect is a multiplier which is calculated from <br>the actual hematocrit (Bloodvol.Hct) and the normal <br>hematocrit (NORMALHCT). <br><br>Under normal physiological conditions, actual hematocrit<br>and normal hematocrit are the same and HctEffect is 1.0. <br>If actual hematocrit is less than normal hematocrit,<br>then HctEffect is less than 1.0 and the calculated <br>hemoglobin concentration [Total] is less than [Basic].
