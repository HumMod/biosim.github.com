<p>EPOPool.Mass
<p>Definition
<p>The EPOPool.Mass is the calculated amount of EPO <br>at any given time. It is a function of EPO secretion<br>rate, EPO clearance and the volume of distribution.<br><br>Experimentation in rats examining the rapid <br>disappearance phase after a single injection of <br>EPO, suggests a distribution space of twice the <br>plasma volume or 40% of the extracellular fluid <br>volume(ECFV). If we assume an EPO mass is typically<br>136U and a volume of distribution of 40% of the ECFV,<br>this results in a typical plasma concentration of<br>22 mU/ml. There is no evidence that clearance of EPO <br>is subject to any physiological regulation. Thus <br>changes in serum [EPO] result from changes in <br>production. Normal levels of [EPO] range from 10-30mU/mL<br><br>Reissmann KR, Diederich DA, Ito K, Schmans JW.<br>Influence of disappearance rate and distribution <br>space on plasma concentration of erthropoietin <br>in normal rats.

<p>Overview
<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein <br>which increases red blood cell (RBC) <br>production in response to decreases in <br>tissue oxygenation. EPO stimulates the <br>production of proerythroblasts from <br>hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.<br>In adult humans, 90% of all erythropoietin<br>is formed in the kidneys. The cellular <br>site of production in the kidney are interstitial<br>renal cells in the inner cortex lying in immediate <br>proximity to the proximal tubules. The remainder<br>is formed in the liver. Although the exact liver cell<br>type involved has not been isolated, hepatocytes,<br>Kupffer cells and small interstitial cells are<br>all possibilities. The hepatic component of <br>erythropoietin production is small( 5 - 15%).<br><br>Although increased secretion of erythropoietin <br>occurs within minutes of a decrease in renal tissue <br>oxygenation ,it takes several days before there <br>is an increase in the red blood <br>cell concentration - this is the EPO delay.<br><br>Erslev, A.J.
