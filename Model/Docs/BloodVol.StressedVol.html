<p>BloodVol.StressedVol
<p>Definition
<p>Blood vessels can be filled part-way with no increase in <br>pressure. The volume that marks the transition between no <br>pressure and a pressure increase is called the unstressed <br>volume and is designated by V0. Additional volume in excess <br>of V0 which causes any increase in pressure  is the stressed <br>volume. The sum of stressed and unstressed volumes is the <br>total blood volume.<br>Stressed volume = Blood volume - unstressed volume.
