<p>Overview
<p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is also known as atrial <br>natriuretic factor(ANF) and atriopeptin.  ANP is a potent <br>natriuretic peptide involved in hormonal regulation of <br>extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure homeostasis. <br>It is secreted by the atrial walls of the heart <br>in response to stretch, which can occur from excess blood <br>volume. ANP acts on the kidneys to cause small increases in <br>glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and decreases in in sodium <br>reabsorption by the collecting ducts.<br><br>Reviews<br>Ruskoaho H.
