<p>Overview
<p>RBCs are produced in the bone marrow. The total <br>mass of red blood cells is regulated by tissue <br>oxygenation and the hormone erythropoietin [EPO]. <br>Hypoxia results in an increase in [EPO]production <br>which enhances RBC production.EPO controls erythrocyte <br>production by retarding DNA breakdown and preventing <br>apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells.<br><br>Erslev, A.J. Erythropoietin. <br>Leukemia Research Volume 14, No. 8: 683-688, 1990
<p>Concentration Units
<p>RBC Volume is typically 2400mL. The red cell volume <br>is a function of the initial volume,red cell loss <br>through either increases in clearance rates or <br>loss through hemorrhage and red cell gain by either <br>increases in production or by transfusion.
