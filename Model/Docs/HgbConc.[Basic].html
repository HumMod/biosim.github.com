<p>HgbConc.[Basic]
<p>Definition
<p>[Basic] is the hemoglobin concentration set by the<br>model user at the start of the simulation. Under<br>normal physiological conditions [Basic] is 0.15g/ml.<br>The model user can set [Basic] from levels close to <br>zero up to a maximum of 0.3g/ml.
<p>Overview
<p>Each red blood cell is comprised of water and solids, <br>the latter in the form of hemoglobin. When the hematocrit <br>and the quantity of hemoglobin in each respective cell are <br>normal, the whole blood of men contains an average of 15grams <br>of hemoglobin per 100mL of blood; for women, it contains an <br>average of 14grams/dL.<br><br>Each gram of hemoglobin can bind with a maximum of 1.34mL of<br>oxygen. Therefore, 15 times 1.34 equals 20.1, which means that<br>the 15 grams of hemoglobin in 100mL blood can combine with a <br>total of almost exactly 20 milliliters of oxygen if the <br>hemoglobin is 100% saturated. <br><br>Textbook of Medical Physiology.
