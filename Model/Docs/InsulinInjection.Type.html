<p>InsulinInjection.Type
<p>Overview
<p>Insulin can be administered in two ways for the treatment<br>of diabetes. The first is by multiple daily injections <br>(MDI); the second by continuous subcutaneous insulin <br>infusion. In the model, the latter method of administration <br>is the InsulinPump.<br><br>Multiple daily injections (MDI) occurs under the structure<br>name "Insulin Injection" and is not yet functional in the <br>current model. Diabetic patients usually inject four or more<br>times daily using a combination of short- and long-acting <br>insulins. Injections are given subcutaneously   <br><br>Ginsberg S, Block MB, Mako ME, Rubenstein AH.<br>Serum insulin levels following administration of <br>exogenous insulin. <br>J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 36:1175 - 1179, 1973<br><br>Galloway JA, Spradlin CT, Nelson RL, Wentworth SM, <br>Davidson JA, Swarner JL.

<p>Physical Units
<p>Units for insulin pool are mU.<br>Units for [plasma] are uU/mL.<br><br>An international unit (U) is<br>1/24 mG. <br>Molecular weight of Insulin is 5754.<br><br>uU * 0.04167 = nG<br>uU * 0.007241 = pMol
<p>Concentration Units
<p>A typical maintenance dose of insulin is 40U/day<br>The insulin can have three different durations of action:<br>rapid (4 hours); intermediate (10 hours) and long acting<br>(18 hours). This is InsulinInjection.Type.
