<p>Overview
<p>Glucagon is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis.<br>In short term studies glucose recovery from hypoglycemia <br>was shown to be impaired by ~40% when the glucagon <br>secretory response was suppressed.<br>Rizza RA, Cryer PE, Gerich JE. Role of glucagon, <br>epinephrine and growth hormone in human glucose <br>counterregulation: effects of somatostatin and adrenergic <br>blockade on plasma glucose recovery and glucose flux rates<br>following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. <br>J Clin Invest 64:62 - 71, 1979.<br> <br>The physiological control of glucagon secretion however <br>is not completely understood. The debate continues as to <br>whether alpha cells directly sense and respond to <br>fluctuations in plasma glucose or whether the response <br>is mediated by the autonomic nervous system and/or the <br>paracrine/endocrine effects of secretory products from <br>other islet cells. Evidence suggests that intra-islet <br>insulin, somatostatin and zinc respectively may play <br>prominent roles for regulating glucagon release in <br>response to hypoglycemia.<br><br>In the model, glucagon secretion is controlled by <br>plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations <br>respectively. As plasma glucose levels decrease, glucagon <br>secretion increases. As plasma insulin levels increase,<br>glucagon secretion decreases. The model does not delineate<br>the various mechanisms involved.<br><br>Gromada J, Franklin I, Wollheim CB. Alpha cells of the<br>endocrine pancreas: 35 years of research but the enigma<br>remains.
