<p>HepaticArty.Conductance
<p>Definition
<p>Conductance is a measure of the blood flow through <br>a vessel for a given pressure difference. It is the<br>exact reciprocal of resistance. For the hepatic artery<br>the pressure gradient is the difference between<br>systemic arterial pressure and splanchnic venous pressure.<br>Basic Conductance is conductance when the viscosity is 1.
<p>Physical Units
<p>Flow is expressed in mL/min<br>Conductance is expressed as (mL/Min)/mmHg<br>Pressure gradient in mmHg
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Typical values for hepatic artery blood flow is <br>250mL/min. Arterial pressure is 97mmHg and splanchnic <br>venous pressure 8mmHg for a pressure gradient of 89mmHg<br>Typical conductance units for the hepatic artery are<br>2.8(mL/Min)/mmHg
