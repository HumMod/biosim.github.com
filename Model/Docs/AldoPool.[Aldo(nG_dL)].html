<p>AldoPool.[Aldo(nG/dL)]
<p>Definition
<p>[Aldo] is the plasma concentration of aldosterone.
<p>Physical Units
<p>Aldo concentrations have been expressed in nG/100ml<br>and pMol/L. <br>1pMol = 360.4pG = 0.3604nG<br>1pMol/L = 0.36nG/L = 0.036nG/100ml<br>1nG/100mL = 27.75pMol/L<br>12 nG/100mL = 333pMol/L
<p>Concentration Units
<p>A typical [Aldo]concentration is 330pMol/L or 12nG/dL.<br>Molecular weight of aldosterone is 360.45. <br>Thus 1 pMol = 360.45 pG.<br><br>The Merck Index. 12th Edition 1996
<p>Overview
<p>Aldosterone is an adrenocortical steroid secreted by the <br>glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone plays <br>a pivotal role in electrolyte and fluid balance and also <br>influences acid-base homeostasis. Secretion of aldosterone <br>is highly regulated and is mainly controlled by the the <br>extracellular concentration of angiotensin II and potassium, <br>both of which stimulate its secretion. Aldosterone increases <br>renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium.  <br><br>RE Booth, JP Johnson, JD Stockand.
