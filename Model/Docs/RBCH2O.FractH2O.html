<p>RBCH2O.FractH2O
<p>Definition
<p>FractH2O is the amount of water contained in the red cell. <br>It is expressed as a fraction of the total volume of the <br>red cell.<br>FractH2O = 1.0 - RBCSolids.FractSolids.<br>FractH2O is set by the model user by changing the parameter<br>FractSolids using a sliding bar in HumMod. As the amount of <br>solids in the red cell increase, the amount of H2O decreases.
<p>Overview
<p>Each red blood cell is comprised of water and solids, <br>the latter in the form of hemoglobin.
