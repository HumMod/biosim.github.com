<p>Viscosity.ConductanceEffect
<p>Overview
<p>Conductance is a measure of the blood flow through <br>a vessel for a given pressure difference. It is the<br>exact reciprocal of resistance. Since viscosity affects<br>resistance to flow, viscosity also affects conductance. <br>As viscosity increases, conductance decreases.
<p>Physical Units
<p>The viscosity of normal blood is about 3 times as great<br>as the viscosity of water.
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Viscosity at a normal hematocrit of 0.44 is expressed as 1<br><br>Relationship of hematocrit to viscosity is described in <br>the following references:<br><br>Fan FC, Chen RY, Schuessler GB and Chien S.
