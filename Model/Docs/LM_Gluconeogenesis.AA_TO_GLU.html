<p>Overview
<p>The liver plays a key role in the maintenance of blood glucose <br>homeostasis. It releases glucose in the fasted state and takes <br>up and stores some of the glucose ingested in meals. In doing <br>so the liver ensures an even and predictable supply of glucose <br>to the extrahepatic tissues, primarily the brain.<br><br>The liver is able to release glucose to the circulation from<br>its glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) and it has the capacity <br>to take up the 3-carbon fragments lactate, pyruvate, glycerol <br>and amino acids and convert these to glucose. The latter process <br>is called gluconeogenesis. <br><br>In the overnight fasted state, the liver is the main source of <br>glucose production and it is widely believed that glycogenolysis<br>and gluconeogenesis each contribute approximately 50% of glucose<br>turnover in healthy subjects. <br><br>During continued fasting,gluconeogenesis from both the kidneys<br>and the liver account for almost all glucose production. <br><br>Ekberg K, Landau BR, Wajngot A, Chandramouli V, Efendic S, <br>Brunengraber H, Wahren J.
