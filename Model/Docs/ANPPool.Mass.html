<p>ANPPool.Mass
<p>Definition
<p>Mass is the calculated amount of ANP at any <br>any given time. Change in the ANP pool or mass is a <br>function of both gains and losses in ANP over time. <br>Gains may occur from increases in ANP secretion rate,<br>from infusion of ANP using the ANP pump feature of HumMod. <br>Changes in the pool are calculated in the model using two <br>mathematical variables, F1 and F2, which integrate gains and <br>losses over time. A Backward Euler integral is used in this<br>calculation because it gives a more stable solution set.
