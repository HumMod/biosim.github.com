<p>Overview
<p>Insulin is synthesized in the islet beta cells of the <br>pancreas and stored in secretory granules within the <br>cytoplasm. Recent studies utilizing both capacitance <br>measurements and electron microscopy of pancreatic beta <br>cells suggests that the secretory granules are divided <br>into two distinct functional pools - a readily releasable<br>pool of granules that is docked at the plasma membrane <br>and can undergo exocytosis immediately when the cell is <br>stimulated, and a reserve pool located in the cytoplasm <br>which is recruited to replenish the readily releasable<br>pool. This correlates well with the biphasic release of <br>insulin seen in healthy individuals. The first phase reflects<br>exocytosis of the readily releasable pool of granules while <br>the second phase is due to release of the reserve pool of <br>granules. Most of the granules (95%) belong to reserve pool<br>and need to be chemically modified to become immediately <br>available for release. The mobilization of the reserve <br>pool granules into the readily releasable pool involves<br>one or several ATP -dependent reactions.<br><br>Rorsman P, Eliasson L, Renstrom E, Gromada J, Barg S,<br>Gopel S.

<p>Definition
<p>The change in insulin storage is defined as the change in <br>mass of insulin in the pancreas as a result of secretion <br>(loss) and synthesis (gain).
