<p>AldoSecretion.[K+]Effect
<p>Overview
<p>Aldosterone is an adrenocortical steroid secreted by the <br>glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone plays <br>a pivotal role in electrolyte and fluid balance and also <br>influences acid-base homeostasis. Secretion of aldosterone <br>is highly regulated and is mainly controlled by the the <br>extracellular concentration of angiotensin II and potassium, <br>both of which stimulate its secretion. Aldosterone increases <br>renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium.  <br><br>Himathongkam K, Dluhy RG, Williams GH. <br>Potassium-aldosterone-renin interrelationships. <br>J Clin Endo Metab 41: 153 - 159, 1975.<br><br>DL Davies,DG Beevers,JJ Brown, AMM Cumming, R Fraser, AF Lever, <br>PA Mason, JJ Morton, JIS Robertson, M Titterington, M Tree. <br>Aldosterone and its stimuli in normal and hypertensive man: <br>Are essential hypertension and primary hyperaldosteronism <br>without tumor the same condition?<br>J Endocrinology 81: 79P - 91P, 1979.<br><br>Quinn SJ, Williams GH.

<p>Potassium Effect
<p>An increase in plasma K+ levels stimulates aldosterone secretion. <br>In HumMOd, the effect of potassium levels on aldosterone <br>secretion are expressed as multiples of of base secretion. At a<br>normal potassium plasma concentration of 4.4mEq/L, the K+Effect on <br>aldosterone secretion is 1.0. As plasma potassium levels rise, <br>the K+ effect increases. Data for the curve relating plasma <br>potassium levels to multiples of aldosterone secretion come from<br>a variety of papers listed below.  <br><br>Scholer D, Birkhauser M, Peytremann A, Riondel AM, Vallotton MB,<br>Muller AF.
