<p>Overview
<p>Midodrine hydrochloride forms an active metabolite, desglymidodrine<br>that is an alpha 1-agonist, and exerts its action via activation of<br>the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature,<br>producing an increase in vasculature tone and elevation of blood pressure.<br>Midodrine hydrochloride is converted to desglymidodrine in the liver<br>and is excreted by the kidney.  <br>Midodrine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is therefore <br>not associated with effects on the central nervous system. It is<br>used in the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. <br><br>Midodrine is almost completely absorbed after oral administration<br>with a bioavailability (as desglymidodrine) of 93%<br><br>Wright RA, Kaufman HC, Perera R, Opfer-Gehrking TL, McElligott MA, <br>Sheng KN, Low PA. A double-blind, dose-response study of midodrine<br>in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Neurology 51: 120-124, 1998
