<p>Definition
<p>Changes in the potassium pool or mass are a function of gains <br>and losses in potassium over time. Gains can occur from potassium<br>in the diet via reabsorption from the GI lumen; movement of<br>potassium out of cells ;from intravenous administration or <br>from transfusion.<br> <br>Losses in potassium can occur in urine; potassium movement <br>into cells; from sweating; from hemorrhage and during <br>dialysis.
<p>Overview
<p>Extracellular potassium concentration is closely regulated<br>and is a function of the balance between rates of intake and <br>excretion of potassium. Maintenance of normal potassium<br>balance requires the kidneys to adjust their excretion rapidly <br>and precisely to wide variations in intake.<br><br>Control of potassium distribution between the extracellular <br>and intracellular compartments also plays an important role <br>in potassium homeostasis. Because over 98 percent of the <br>total body potassium is contained in the cells, they can serve <br>as an overflow site for excess extracellular fluid potassium <br>during hyperkalemia or as a source of potassium during <br>hypokalemia. <br><br><br>In HumMOd, potassium is divided into extracellular K (KPool)<br>and cellular K (KCell)   <br><br>Young DB.
