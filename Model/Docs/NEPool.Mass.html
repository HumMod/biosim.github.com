<p>NEPool.Mass
<p>Definition
<p>Mass or pool is the calculated amount of circulating<br>NE. Gains and losses in NE are integrated over time<br>to calculate the NE Pool or mass.
<p>Overview
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released <br>from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons. <br>Norepinephrine is also released from the adrenal medullae <br>in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. <br>Under resting conditions, only a few percent of the NE <br>entering the plasma represents adrenal medullary secretion. <br>The remainder has its source in the neurotransmitter released <br>by sympathetic nerve varicosities. This NE is referred to <br>as spillover. Total body spillover can be measured using a <br>tracer kinetic method based on dilution of [3H]NE by endogenous NE.<br><br>Esler M, Jennings G, Lambert G, Meredith I, Horne M, Eisenhofer G.<br>Overflow of catecholeamine neurotransmitters to the circulation:<br>Source, fate and Functions.

In patients with pheochromocytoma, an <br>increase in plasma NE causes symptoms which include <br>hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. <br>These symptoms reflect the effects of norepinephrine <br>on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.
