<p>Definition
<p>
<p>Physical Units
<p>mL
<p>Concentration Units
<p>RBC solids are typically 820mL or 0.34 as expressed <br>as a fraction of total RBC volume.
<p>Overview
<p>Each red blood cell is comprised of water and solids, <br>the latter in the form of hemoglobin. Red cells have <br>the ability to concentrate hemoglobin in the cell fluid <br>up to 34grams in each 100mL of cells. In certain clinical <br>conditions (hypochromic anemia), inadequate quantities of <br>transferrin result in red cells that contain much less <br>hemoglobin than normal.
