<p>RBCSecretion.Rate
<p>Overview
<p>RBCs are produced in the bone marrow. The total <br>mass of red blood cells is regulated by tissue <br>oxygenation and the hormone erythropoietin [EPO]. <br>Hypoxia results in an increase in [EPO]production <br>which enhances RBC production.<br><br>RBCs normally circulate an average of 120 days <br>before being destroyed. As the cells age, the <br>cell membrane becomes more fragile and the cells <br>rupture during passage through some tight spot <br>in the circulation, particularly in the spleen.
<p>Physical Units
<p>Mass mL<br>Flux mL/min<br>RBC volume mL
<p>Concentration Units
<p>RBC concentrations have been expressed number per <br>cubic millimeter.<br><br>A typical concentration is 5,200,000 (plus or minus 300,000)<br>in men and 4,700,000 (plus or minus 300,000) in women.<br><br>A typical RBC secretion and clearance rate is 0.014mL/min
