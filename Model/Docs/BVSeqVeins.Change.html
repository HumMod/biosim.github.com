<p>Overview
<p>Sequestered blood volume is a term used to explain the<br>changes in blood volume distribution and venous return<br>when a subject moves from a lying to a standing postion. <br>As the subject changes from a lying to standing position,<br>total blood volume does not acutely change, however <br>venous return falls as if some blood has been lost. The <br>(virtual) amount of blood that appears to be lost is called <br>sequestered. Some is in the arteries (BVSeqArtys) and some <br>in the veins (BVSeqVeins) of the lower extremities.<br>In the model we assume about 75% of sequestered volume is <br>in the veins and and 25% in the arteries.<br><br>In the lying position, assume a pressure of 11mmHg in the<br>veins and a sequestered volume of 150mL. Moving to a <br>standing position changes venous pressure to 50mmHg and <br>the venous sequestered volume to 600mL.<br><br>Vascular compliance plays a role in sequestration since <br>the amount sequestered depends on the distending (orthostatic) <br>pressure versus the vascular compliance pushing back - <br>together they affect the transmural pressure (TMP)<br><br>Thornton WE, Moore TP, Pool SL Fluid Shifts in Weightlessness<br>Aviat.Space Environ Med 58(9, Suppl.):A86-90, 1987.<br><br>Moore TP, Thornton WE Space shuttle inflight and postflight <br>fluid shifts measured by leg volume changes. <br>Aviat Space Environ.
