<p>Overview
<p>Sequestered blood volume is a term used to explain the<br>changes in blood volume distribution and venous return<br>when a subject moves from a lying to a standing postion. <br>As the subject changes from a lying to standing position,<br>total blood volume does not acutely change, however <br>venous return falls as if some blood has been lost. The <br>(virtual) amount of blood that appears to be lost is called <br>sequestered. Some is in the arteries and some in the veins <br>of the lower extremities. Vascular compliance plays a role <br>in sequestration since the amount sequestered depends on <br>the distending (orthostatic) pressure versus the vascular <br>compliance pushing back.<br><br>For reference about sequestered blood volume see:<br>Thornton WE, Moore TP, Pool SL Fluid Shifts in Weightlessness<br>Aviat.Space Environ Med 58(9, Suppl.):A86-90, 1987.<br><br>Moore TP, Thornton WE Space shuttle inflight and postflight <br>fluid shifts measured by leg volume changes. <br>Aviat Space Environ.
