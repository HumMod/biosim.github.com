<p>Overview
<p>Glucose is the final product of carbohydrate digestion and is <br>used as a fuel source for the production of ATP in the cells <br>of the body.  Glucose is the principal fuel source for the brain <br>and cerebral function is critically dependent on maintaining <br>plasma glucose levels within narrow limits.<br>Plasma glucose levels depend on the rates of entry of glucose <br>into the circulation and of its uptake into the tissues. <br>The main tissues that regulate blood glucose levels are the <br>liver (by glucose production and uptake) and skeletal muscle <br>(glucose uptake). The hormones insulin and glucagon function <br>as important feedback control systems for maintaining a normal <br>blood glucose concentration. <br><br>Immediately after a high-carbohydrate meal, the glucose that <br>is absorbed into the blood causes an increase in plasma <br>concentration of glucose and subsequent rapid secretion of <br>insulin.  Insulin causes rapid uptake and storage of glucose <br>by almost all tissues of the body but especially by the muscles, <br>adipose tissue, and liver. Excess glucose is stored in the <br>form of glycogen. Insulin also inhibits glycogen breakdown <br>and glucose release by the liver. Between meals, when <br>food is not available and the blood glucose concentration <br>begins to fall, insulin secretion decreases rapidly and <br>secretion of glucagon increases. Liver glycogen is split back <br>into glucose (glycogenolysis) and released back into the <br>blood to maintain the plasma glucose levels. The decrease <br>in insulin secretion and increase in glucagon release also<br>causes increased gluconeogenesis in the liver and results in <br>the breakdown and use of stored glucose, fats and proteins.  <br>Both of these effects greatly enhance the availability of <br>glucose to other organs of the body. <br><br>Kruszynska YT.
