<p>Definition
<p>During startup, the model user defines the particular <br>traits of the HumMod patient. These are gender, body size, <br>age, muscularity and adiposity. All of these traits <br>influence body volumes, most notably the extracellular <br>fluid volume (ECFV). The assumption is made that<br>while volumes may change with traits, concentrations do <br>not. At startup,initial volumes,especially ECFV and plasma <br>volume are calculated. A target concentration is specified <br>- in this case Target[EPO]. <br><br>The initial mass or circulating pool is the Target[EPO] <br>multiplied by the initial volume of distribution.<br> <br>Initial Mass = Target[EPO]*InitialVolDist
<p>Overview
<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein <br>which increases red blood cell (RBC) <br>production in response to decreases in <br>tissue oxygenation. EPO stimulates the <br>production of proerythroblasts from <br>hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.<br>In adult humans, 90% of all erythropoietin<br>is formed in the kidneys. The cellular <br>site of production in the kidney are interstitial<br>renal cells in the inner cortex lying in immediate <br>proximity to the proximal tubules. The remainder<br>is formed in the liver. Although the exact liver cell<br>type involved has not been isolated, hepatocytes,<br>Kupffer cells and small interstitial cells are<br>all possibilities. The hepatic component of <br>erythropoietin production is small( 5 - 15%).<br><br>Although increased secretion of erythropoietin <br>occurs within minutes of a decrease in renal tissue <br>oxygenation ,it takes several days before there <br>is an increase in the red blood <br>cell concentration - this is the EPO delay.<br><br>Erslev, A.J.
