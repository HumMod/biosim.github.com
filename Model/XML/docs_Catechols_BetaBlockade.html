&lt;label&gt; Adrenergic Receptor Overview &lt;/label&gt;<br>
&lt;content&gt;<br>
<br>
The concept of a receptive mechanism was first introduced <br>
by Langley to explain the action of curare on skeletal muscle(1).<br>
Dale (2), however, was probably the first to make significant use <br>
of the receptor concept in connection with the sympathetic nervous <br>
system. Ahlquist in his landmark paper of 1948(3), established two<br>
fundamental concepts: first, that a single sympathetic mediator<br>
could produce both excitatory and inhibitory responses; and second,<br>
that adrenergic receptors were of two different types, alpha and <br>
beta receptors, based on rank order potency of activation by agonists.<br>
Lands et al.(4) subsequently showed that beta receptors can be<br>
subdivided into beta-1 receptors and beta 2 receptors. Alpha <br>
receptors can also be subdivided into alpha-1 and alpha-2 depending <br>
on the relative potencies of certain alpha agonists and <br>
antagonists(5). Currently nine different subtypes of adrenergic <br>
receptors have been cloned and pharmacologically catagorized (6).   <br>
Therefore the relative effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine <br>
on different effector organs are determined by the types of receptors <br>
in the organs. Furthermore certain alpha functions are excitatory, <br>
whereas others are inhibitory. Likewise certain beta functions are <br>
excitatory and others are inhibitory. Therefore, alpha and beta <br>
receptors are not necessarly associated with excitation or <br>
inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the <br>
receptors in the given effector organ<br>

The model user can block the effect of beta receptor stimulation.<br>
Reeptor blockade is applied at individual organs. Effect is<br>
1.0 when there is no blockade. For example,a 16% blockade results <br>
in an effect of 0.84.<br>
There are a number of drugs known as beta antagonists which can <br>
be used clinically to cause beta blockade. These include <br>
propranolol and metoprolol.<br>
