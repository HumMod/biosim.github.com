<p> Exercise > Hemodynamics

<p>
Cardiac output increases with the intensity of aerobic exercise.  Oxygen
delivery is a function of this increased flow and increased oxygen extraction.

<p>
Heart rate also increases with increasing intensity of exercise, until a
maximum of about 190 beats per minute is reached.

<p>
Heart rate does not increase instantaneously, but instead increases quickly
and smoothly, with a time constant of about 45 seconds (Edwards et. al.
1972), as shown above.

<p>
Cardiac output is equal to heart rate multiplied by stroke volume.  Most of
the increase in cardiac output in exercise is associated with an increase in
heart rate, as the figure above shows.

<p>
Stroke volume jumps up with light exercise and then increases slowly as
exercise intensity increases.

<p>
Total peripheral resistance falls dramatically as the intensity of
exercise increases.

<p>
Systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressures all increase as the intensity
of exercise increases.

Note the increase in pulse pressure.
