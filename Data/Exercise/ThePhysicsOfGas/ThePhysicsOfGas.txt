The Physics Of Gas


Since pressure and temperature affect the volume of a gas, care must be taken in describing volume.

Conventions

There are several different conventions that are used to describe a volume of gas.

ATP  Ambient temperature and pressure or, in other words, room air.

ATPS  Ambient temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor.  This is expired air, as found in a spirometer that has cooled down to room (ambient) temperature but is still saturated with water vapor.

BTPS  Body temperature, barometric pressure, saturated with water vapor.  This is exhaled air.  Pulmonary volumes and flows are reported using this convention.

STPD  Standard temperature and pressure dry.  The standard temperature is 273.2 Kelvin or 0 ºC.  The standard pressure is 760 mmHg or 1 Atm.  This is the convention used to report oxygen and carbon dioxide fluxes and solubility in blood and tissues.

One Mol of gas at STPD occupies 22.4 L.

Physics

The interrelationship between the volume, pressure and temperature of a gas is:

	PV = nRT						(1)

	P = Pressure (N/M2)
	V = Volume (M3)
	n = Molecules (kMol)
	R = Universal Gas Constant (J/(kMol Kelvin))
	T = Temperature (Kelvin)

	R = 8314

Conversions

Using the gas law above and keeping n and R constant, changes in environment or convention (from 1 to 2) are related by:

	P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2					(2)

or

	V1 = V2 * (P2/P1) * (T1/T2)				(3)

Thus, it is possible to convert data from BTPS to STPD and vice versa.  Using body temperature of 37 ºC and partial pressure of 47 mmHg for saturated water vapor at body temperature:

	VBTPS = VSTPD * (760/713) * (310.2/273.2)	(4)

or

	VBTPS = 1.21 * VSTPD					(5)

Going the other way

	VSTPD = 0.826 * VBTPS				(6)

There are physiological influences on these conversions.  One is the increase in body temperature that occurs with exercise.  Another is the decrease in barometric pressure with increasing altitude.
