<p> Exercise > The Physics Of Gas

<p>
Since pressure and temperature affect the volume of a gas, care must be taken
in describing volume.

<p><img src="../../../Dot.png">
Conventions

<p>
There are several different conventions that are used to describe a volume
of gas.

<p>
ATP.  Ambient temperature and pressure or, in other words, room air.

<p>
ATPS.  Ambient temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor.  This is
expired air, as found in a spirometer that has cooled down to room (ambient)
temperature but is still saturated with water vapor.

<p>
BTPS.  Body temperature, barometric pressure, saturated with water vapor.
This is exhaled air.  Pulmonary volumes and flows are reported using this
convention.

<p>
STPD.  Standard temperature and pressure dry.  The standard temperature is
273.2 Kelvin or 0 ºC.  The standard pressure is 760 mmHg or 1 Atm.  This is
the convention used to report oxygen and carbon dioxide fluxes and solubility
in blood and tissues.

<p>
One Mol of gas at STPD occupies 22.4 L.

Physics

<p>
The interrelationship between the volume, pressure and temperature of a gas is:

<p class='Indent'>
PV = nRT (#1)

<p class='Indent'>
P = Pressure (N/M2)
<br>
V = Volume (M3)
<br>
n = Molecules (kMol)
<br>
R = Universal Gas Constant (J/(kMol Kelvin))
<br>
T = Temperature (Kelvin)

<p class='Indent'>
R = 8314

Conversions

<p>
Using the gas law above and keeping n and R constant, changes in environment
or convention are related by:

<p class='Indent'>
P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> (#2)

<p>
or

<p class='Indent'>
V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> * (P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>) * (T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>) (#3)

<p>
Thus, it is possible to convert data from BTPS to STPD and vice versa.  Using
body temperature of 37 ºC and partial pressure of 47 mmHg for saturated water
vapor at body temperature:

<p class='Indent'>
VBTPS = VSTPD * (760/713) * (310.2/273.2) (#4)

<p>
or

<p class='Indent'>
VBTPS = 1.21 * VSTPD (#5)

<p>
Going the other way

<p class='Indent'>
VSTPD = 0.826 * VBTPS (#6)

<p>
There are physiological influences on these conversions.  One is the increase
in body temperature that occurs with exercise and fever.  Another is the
decrease in barometric pressure with increasing altitude.
