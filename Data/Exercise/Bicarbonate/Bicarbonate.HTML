<p> Exercise > Bicarbonate

<p>
The total carbon dioxide in blood is proportional to its partial
pressure, as shown below.

<p><img src='Bicarbonate-1.png' class='Indent'>

<p>
The slope of the CO2 solubility curve between 40 and 45 mmHg is
0.0045 (mL/mL)/mmHg.  Blood passing through the lungs looses 0.04
mL/mL of CO2 while pCO2 decreases 5 mmHg, as shown below.

<p>
A little bit more than ½ of the CO<sub>2</sub> loss in the lungs is
due to the 5 mmHg excursion down the venous dissociation curve.  The
remainder of the CO<sub>2</sub> loss is due to the downward shift in
the dissociation curve, the Haldane effect, as pO<sub>2</sub> increases
from 40 mmHg (75% saturation) to 100 mmHg (100% saturation).

<p>
While the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood is a function of the
partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, it is an even more sensitive
function of the strong ion difference (see <i>Acid-Base Balance</i>).
This relationship is shown below.

<p>
Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is actually in the form of
bicarbonate, with small fractions in solution and bound to the amino
acids of red cell hemoglobin and plasma proteins.

<p>
Direct solubility is 0.00069 mL/mL for each mmHg of partial pressure
(Austin et. al. 1963).  Thus, about 5% of the blood’s carbon dioxide
is in solution.

<p>
The distribution of CO2 in the blood appears to be

<p class='Indent'>
Bicarbonate – 88%
<br>
In Solution – 5%
<br>
Carbamino Bonds – 7%

<p>
This distribution can be used to estimate blood bicarbonate concentration
using total blood CO2 data.

Skeletal Muscle

<p>
Bicarbonate concentration in skeletal muscle is less than bicarbonate
concentration in blood, with typical values of 10 mMol/L in skeletal
muscle (Sahlin et. al. 1977, Sahlin et. al. 1978).

<p>
Bicarbonate concentration in skeletal muscle falls to 4.6 mMol/L after
exhaustive exercise (Sahlin et. al. 1978) and then returns to control
with a time constant of roughly 20 minutes.

<p>
Lactate concentration rose from 2 mMol/L to 29, suggesting that the
strong ion difference in skeletal muscle is in the range of 50 to
60 mEq/L.

General Tissue

<p>
There not be a single value for tissue bicarbonate content in general.

<p>
Raichle et. al. (1979) reported 16 mMol/L at a pCO2 of 45 mmHg in
rhesus monkeys, shown below.

<p><img src='Bicarbonate-5.png' class='Indent'>

<p>
This is a greater CO2 content than the values reported for skeletal
muscle.

Chemistry

<p>
The molecular weight of bicarbonate (HCO3-) is 61.

<p><img src="../../../Dot.png">
Units

<p>
Total blood CO<sub>2</sub> content is reported as mL (of gas) / mL
(of blood) and also as mMol/L.

<p>
A mMol of gas occupies a standard volume of 22.4 mL.  Multiply mL/mL
by 44.6 to get mMol/L

<p>
The favored units for bicarbonate are mEq/L.
