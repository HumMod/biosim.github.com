Exercise > Units

<p>
The field of exercise physiology sees data published using more than one
set of physical units to represent force, work and power.  There are a
variety of units used in the older English system and there is the newer
international system (Dybkaer 1969, Kappagoda and Linden 1976).

<p>
The English system has been with us a long time.  It has it roots in the
inch, foot, yard, pound, and so forth.

<p>
The international system, defined in 1954, is known formally as <i>Système
International d’Unités</i> or simply SI.  This system has its roots in the
formal definition of the meter (or metre) in France in 1800.

Basic SI Units

<p>
The unit for length is the <i>meter</i> (M).  The unit for time is the
<i>second</i> (Sec).  Velocity is then meters/second (M/Sec).  Acceleration
is meters/second<sup>2</sup> (M/Sec<sup>2</sup>).

<p>
The unit for mass is <i>kilogram</i> (kG).

<p><img src='../../../Dot.png'>
Force

<p>
Force is mass multiplied by acceleration, so the units are kG.M/Sec<sup>2
</sup>.  The <i>Newton</i> (N) is used as a unit of force in honor of the
English physicist, Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727).

<p class='Indent'>
1 kG.M/Sec<sup>2</sup> = 1 N

<p>
Now we go back to the good old days.  The pound was defined by a metal
cylinder stored in London.  While we normally think of the pound as a
measure of weight, it was also thought of as a measure of force.  One
pound of force is the force generated when the standard pound weight is
accelerated by earth’s normal gravity (G<sub>z</sub>).

<p class='Indent'>
G<sub>z</sub> = 9.8 M/Sec

<p>
Now it gets trickier.  The pound weight was replaced by a one kilogram
mass.  The replacement force, called a kilopond (kP), is the force
generated when the kilogram mass is accelerated by earth’s normal
gravity.  This force can be converted to Newtons.

<p class='Indent'>
1 kP = 9.8 N

<p>
Sometimes the kilopond is referred to as a kilogram-force.

<p>
While the kilopond and kilogram-force have been declared obsolete, they
are ubiquitous in the exercise literature.

Work

<p>
Work is force applied over a distance, or force multiplied by distance.
The units are N.M.  The <i>Joule</i> (J) is used as a unit of work in
honor of the Englishman James Prescott Joule (1818 - 1889) one of the
founders of thermodynamics.

<p class='Indent'>
1 N.M = 1 J

<p>
When the English pound of force is used to describe work, it is called
foot-pounds (FP) with the expected units.

<p class='Indent'>
1 FP = 1.36 J

<p>
When the English kilopond is used to describe work, the units are
kilopond-meter (kP?M).

<p class='Indent'>
1 kP.M = 9.8 J

<p>
Sometimes the kilopond-meter is referred to as a kilogram-meter
(kG.M).

<p>
Work is one of the forms of energy.

<p>
Another form of energy is the calorie (Cal).  A calorie is the amount
of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree
C (from 14.5° C to 15.5° C).

<p class='Indent'>
1 Cal = 4.19 J

<p>
The British thermal unit (BTU) also describes the energy needed to heat
water, but it uses pounds of water and degrees F.

<p class='Indent'>
1 BTU = 252 Cal

<p><img src='../../../Dot.png'>
Power

<p>
Power is work divided by time.  The unit is J/Sec.  The <i>Watt</i> (W)
is used as a unit of power in honor of James Watt (1736 - 1819) the
Scottish inventor of a practical steam engine.

<p class='Indent'>
1 J/Sec = 1 W

<p>
Returning to the old English system, we come to the units for power.
The units are kP.M /Min.

<p class='Indent'>
1 kP.M/Min = 0.163 W

<p>
These units are often used to describe the intensity of exercise.

<p>
A useful conversion is Watts to Cal/Min.

<p class='Indent'>
14.3 Cal/Min = 1 W

<p>
There is also the <i>horsepower</i> (HP).

<p class='Indent'>
1 HP = 746 W

Pressure

<p>
Pressure measurements are an important part of exercise physiology.

<p>
Historically, pressure is defined in terms of <i>mmHg</i>, the pressure
that will lift a column of mercury 1 mM in a mercury manometer.

<p>
A <i>Torr</i> is a formal definition of a mmHg and is named in honor of
Evangelista Torricelli (1608 – 1647), a follower of Galileo who invented
the mercury manometer.  Torr and mmHg are roughly synonymous.

<p>
Air pressure at sea level is nominally 760 Torr or 1 <i>Atmosphere</i>.

<p>
<i>Inches of mercury</i> are used to describe big pressures, most notably
barometric pressure.

<p>
For lower pressures, such as pressures in veins, <i>cM H2O</i> are
sometimes used in lieu of mmHg.  One mmHg is equal to 1.359 cM H2O,
based on the densities of mercury and water.

<p>Pressure is force per unit area.  In the SI system, the units for
pressure are N/M2.  The <i>Pascal</i> (Pa) is used as a unit of pressure
in honor of Blaise Pascal (1623 – 1662), a French mathematician who
contributed to the development of the barometer.

<p>
One mmHg is equal to 133.3224 Pa, which is a little big for arterial
pressure values.  So the <i>kiloPascal</i> (kPa) is recommended.  One
mmHg is equal to 0.133 kPa, which is a little small for arterial
pressure values.

<p>
One other unit of pressure that is getting some attention is the
<i>millibar</i>.

<p>
A bar is equal to 100,000 Pa.  So a millibar is equal to 100 Pa and
this is a pretty good unit for arterial blood pressure.  A mmHg is
equal to 1.333224 millibars.
