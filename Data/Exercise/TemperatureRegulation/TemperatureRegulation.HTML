<p> Exercise > Temperature Regulation

<p>
Two different units are used to report temperature.  One is degrees
<i>Celsius</i> (°C), also called <i>centigrade</i>, invented by the
Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701 – 1744).  The other unit is
degrees <i>Fahrenheit</i> (°F), invented by the Dutch physicist D.G.
Fahrenheit (1686 - 1736).

<p>
The formula for conversion is

<p class='Indent'>
°C = (5/9) * (°F – 32)

Core Temperature During Exercise

<p>
Core temperature rises rapidly during exercise (Saltin and Hermansen
1966) as shown below.

<p>
Sympathetic nerve activity increases as exercise begins.  This stimulates
cutaneous alpha receptors, causing the skin to vasoconstrict.  Heat
production far exceeds heat loss and the core temperature increases
rapidly.

<p>
Increased core temperature triggers cutaneous vasodilation and sweating.
Core temperature continues to rise until heat loss is equal to heat
production.  A new steady-state is established at an elevated core temperature.

Malignant Hyperthermia

<p>
Temperature regulation fails at core temperatures at or just above the
maximum core temperatures observed in exercise.  In fact, severe exercise,
a hot environment and malignant hyperthermia (also called <i>heat stroke</i>)
often coexist.

<p>
Malignant hyperthermia is characterized by very high core temperatures and
an absence of sweating (Ferris at. al. 1938).

<p>
Ferris et. al. (1938) observed that hyperthermic patients with a core
temperature below 106 °F were conscious.  None of these patients died.

<p>
Patients with a core temperature of 106 °F to 112 °F were first seen in
a stupor or coma.  Mortality was high in this group in spite of the
treatment.  Gauss and Meyer (1917) observed a mortality rate of 81%
in patients first seen with a core temperature of 110 °F or greater,
in spite of aggressive treatment with cold water.
