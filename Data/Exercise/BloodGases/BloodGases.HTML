<p> Exercise > Blood Gases

<p>
During strenuous exercise, there are significant changes in blood
oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration.

Oxygen

<p>
Arterial oxygen concentration is unchanged with moderate exercise
and actually increases a bit with more strenuous exercise (see <i>Gas
Exchange</i>).  Venous oxygen concentration falls in proportion to
the intensity of exercise, as shown below.

<p>
The venous O<sub>2</sub> concentration and pO<sub>2</sub> drop rapidly
at the onset of exercise due to increased extraction of O<sub>2</sub>
by the working muscle, as shown below.

<p>
Peripheral O<sub>2</sub> extraction is typically 25% at rest, but it
can increase to as high as 75% during strenuous exercise.  The
arteriovenous (A-V) oxygen difference is shown below.

Carbon Dioxide

<p>
Arterial pCO<sub>2</sub> is nearly constant during mild exercise,
showing a slight tendency to increase.  During severe exercise, lactic
acidosis drives up ventilation and arterial pCO<sub>2</sub> tends to
decrease.

<p>
In aerobic exercise, venous pCO<sub>2</sub> increases in proportion to
the severity of the exercise and CO<sub>2</sub> pours out of the working
muscle into the venous blood.  This is shown below.

<p>
Changes in blood carbon dioxide concentration are mainly due to changes
in blood bicarbonate concentration (see <i>Bicarbonate</i>).  Changes
in blood bicarbonate concentration are due changes in pCO<sub>2</sub>
and changes in the strong ion difference – mainly due to increases in
blood lactate.

<p>
On the venous side, increased pCO<sub>2</sub> is roughly balanced by
decreases in strong ion difference.  The venous CO<sub>2</sub> content
tends to increase a bit.  On the arterial side, pCO<sub>2</sub> is
fairly constant (shown above) and the decrease in strong ion difference
dominates.  This is shown below.

<p>
The venous CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and pCO<sub>2</sub> do not rise instantaneously.  Instead, there is a slight delay (shown below) as
aerobic muscle metabolism speeds up and the resulting CO<sub>2</sub>
finds its way into the venous blood.

Chemistry

<p>
The molecular weight of oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) is 32.  The molecular
weight of CO<sub>2</sub> gas (CO2) is 44.

<p><img src="../../../Dot.png">
Units

<p>
The favored units for oxygen and carbon dioxide gas in blood are mL (of
gas) / mL (of blood) and mMol/L.

<p>
For both gases, a mMol of gas occupies a standard volume of 22.4 mL.
Multiply mL/mL by 44.6 to get mMol/L.
