<p> Exercise > Describing Exercise

<p>
The title to this page means describing exercise quantitatively.

<p>
The most direct way to quantify exercise is to measure the work or average
power.  This is possible on a bicycle ergometer, but otherwise it is generally
not possible.

<p>
Oxygen uptake is often measured.  It is proportional to the severity of
exercise during longer duration protocols (i.e. the protocol is aerobic).

<p>
There is a large variation among individuals in the severity of exercise
that can be successfully undertaken.  This variation depends on a number
of factors including size, gender, age and, especially, physical fitness.

<p>
Variation among individuals can severely damage group data sets.  Some
normalization is usually added by expressing oxygen uptake in terms of
percent of maximum oxygen uptake.

Oxygen Consumption During Exercise

<p>
Oxygen consumption increases linearly with the intensity of exercise,
as shown below.

<p>
The slope of the oxygen uptake curve appears to decrease a bit at higher
workloads, as anaerobic metabolism does part of the work.  The slope change
is shown below.

<p>
We can linearize with little error.  Using the data of Hughes et. al. (1982)
the average increase in oxygen consumption is 11.1 (mL/Min)/Watt.

<p>
Exercise intensity of often reported as oxygen uptake.  The following formulas
translate oxygen uptake (mL/Min) to average power (W) and vice versa.

<p class='Indent'>
Power (W) = 0.090 * O2 Uptake (mL/Min) – 22.6
<br>
O2 Uptake (mL/Min)  = 11.1 Power (W) + 250.0

<p>
Most of the oxygen that is consumed goes into heat.  A fraction goes into motion.  Mechanical efficiency as a function of exercise intensity is shown below (Åstrand
et. al. 1959, Åstrand 1960)

<p>
A value of 22% mechanical efficiency is typical for strenuous exercise.  Using
this value, we get the following motion and heat breakdown.

<table class='Indent'>
<tr><td></td><td>O2 (mL/Min)</td><td>Watts</td><td>Cal/Min</td></tr>
<tr><td>Motion</td><td>3.1</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.24</td></tr>
<tr><td>Heat</td><td>11.1</td><td>3.5</td><td>0.83</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td>14.2</td><td>4.5</td><td>1.07</td></tr>
</table>

Duration Of Exercise

<p>
Long periods of exercise are well tolerated when oxygen uptake is 70% of
maximum or less.  Heavier loads turn on anaerobic metabolism, deplete
glycogen and cause muscle fatigue.  Heavier loads end quickly, as shown
below.

<p>
These data are for a single subject.  Oxygen uptake at or near the end
of exercise was 4.0 L/Min.

Maximum Oxygen Uptake

<p>
Maximum oxygen uptake increases to age 20 and decreases thereafter, as
the figure below shows.

<p><img src='DescribingExercise-5.png'>

<p>
Maximum oxygen uptake decreases with bed rest and increases with athletic
training, as the figure below shows (Saltin et. al. 1968).
