Regional Blood Flow


During exercise, blood flow is increased to the working muscle, the respiratory muscles, the left and right heart and the skin.  Blood flow is decreased to inactive muscle, the gut and kidney.

Organ Blood Flows At Rest

Williams and Leggett (1989) suggest the following values for a 35 year old male.  I’ve scaled them to a 75 kG body weight and a cardiac output of 5500 mL/Min.  Numbers in brackets are not summed in calculating the totals.

Animal Studies

There’s not a lot of human data on regional blood flow in exercise, due to the need for invasive protocols.  So I’ve taken the canine treadmill data of Musch et. al. (1987) and presented it as % of control.

Skeletal Muscle - Working

Jorfeldt and Wahren (1971) measured blood flow to the legs during bicycle ergometer exercise.  Data for the whole body are tabulated directly below.

Cronestrand et. al. (1971) had similar results.

Wade et. al. (1956) measured splanchnic blood flow and blood volume at rest and during exercise estimated to be 34 watts.  The response of the splanchnic circulation in 3 subjects is tabluated below.  Blood volume was 5730 mL.  O2 uptake was 230 mL/Min at rest and 718 mL/Min during exercise.
