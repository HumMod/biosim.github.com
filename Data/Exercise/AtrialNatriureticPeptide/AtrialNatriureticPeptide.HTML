<p> Exercise > Atrial Natriuretic Peptide

<p>
Atrial natriuretic peptide is also known as <i>atrial natriuretic
factor</i> and <i>atriopeptin</i>, sometimes abbreviated as ANP
or ANF.

<p>
There are several structurally similar peptides, ranging from 21 to
33 amino acids, which have natriuretic properties.  But one, having
28 amino acids, comes directly from the atria and is quantitatively
the most important.

<p>
Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide increases during
exercise in proportion to the intensity of the exercise.

<p>
The stimulus for increased atrial natriuretic peptide release
appears to be increased pressure and distension at the right
and left atria.

<p>
Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration increases with a
time constant of about 15 minutes.  Thus, ANP measurements made
during short-term exercise will probably not represent steady-state
values.

<p>
The data shown below were collected during upright cycling at 67%
of maximum O2 uptake.

<p>
Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations are greater during
supine exercise than during upright exercise at comparable workloads
(Perrault et. al. 1989), presumably due to the increased central
pressures.

<p>
There is probably no physiological value to ANP increases during
exercise.  The increases can be thought of as an incidental response
to the pressure increases needed to generate large increases in
cardiac output.

Chemistry

<p>
The most important atrial natriuretic peptide has 28 amino acids
and a molecular weight of 3060.

<p>
A typical venous blood concentration is 20 pMol/L.

Units

<p>
Popular units for atrial natriuretic peptide are pG/mL and pMol/L

<p>
To convert pG/mL to pMol/L, multiply by 0.327.
