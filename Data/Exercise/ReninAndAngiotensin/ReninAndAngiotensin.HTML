<p>p Exercise > Renin And Angiotensin

<p>
Renin secretion is stimulated in exercise by increased renal nerve
activity and increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine
concentrations.

<p>
In addition, decreased renal blood flow (see <i>Regional Blood Flow</i>),
decreased glomerular filtration rate (Castenfors 1967, Castenfors and
Piscator 1967) and increased tubular sodium reabsorption modify the
macula densa feedback signal to stimulate renin secretion.

<p>
Because of these stimuli, renal renin secretion rate increases in
exercise in proportion to the intensity of the exercise, as shown
below.

<p>
Following increased renin secretion, plasma renin activity (often
abbreviated PRA) increases, as shown below.

<p>
Plasma renin activity increases with a time constant of 10 – 15
minutes.  Thus, plasma renin activity measurements made during
short-term exercise will probably not represent steady-state values.
And, changes in renin secretion rate during prolonged exercise will
be much more impressive than short-term changes in PRA (see above).

<p>
The data shown above were collected during upright cycling at 67%
of maximum O2 uptake.

<p>
Increased PRA leads to increased plasma angiotensin I ([AI]) and
angiotensin II ([AII]) concentrations.

<p>
With severe exercise, plasma angiotensin concentration rises
proportionally much more than plasma renin activity (Staessen et.
al. 1987, Tidgren et. al. 1991).  The most likely explanation is
that the developing lactic acidosis inhibits the angiotensinases
(Khairallah and Page 1967), decreasing plasma angiotensin
clearance.

Chemistry

<p>
The structure of the decapeptide angiotensin I is shown below.

<p class='Indent'>
NH<sub>2</sub>-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Val-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-COOH

<p>
The octapeptide angiotensin II is formed when converting enzyme
nips the dipeptide His-Leu off C-terminal end of angiotensin I.
The structure of angiotensin II is shown below.

<p class='Indent'>
NH<sub>2</sub>-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Val-His-Pro-Phe-COOH

<p>
Ile replaces Val at position 5 in some species.

<p>
Molecular weight is about 1046.  Composition is
C<sub>49</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>14</sub>O<sub>11</sub>.

<p>
Angiotensin II concentration in plasma is typically 20 pG/mL.

Units

<p>
Plasma renin activity is quantified in terms of the ability of
a sample to generate angiotensin I in the presence of excess
renin substrate.

<p>
The units are <i>Goldblatt</i> units, which is an angiotensin
generation rate of 1 nG per Hour per mL of plasma.

<p>
Popular units for plasma angiotensin II concentration are pMol/L
and pG/mL.

<p>
To convert pMol/L to pG/mL, multiply by 1.05.
