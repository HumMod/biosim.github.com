<p> Exercise > Metabolism

<p>
Working skeletal muscle has four important sources of energy as shown
below.  Data is from Romijn et. al. (1993).

<p>
Plasma fatty acids are replenished by adipose tissue.  Plasma glucose is
replenished by the liver.

Glucose

<p>
The regulation of plasma glucose concentration in exercise is different
than the regulation after a meal.

<p>
After a meal, the glucose absorption rate from the gut is greater than the
glucose disposal rate.  Blood glucose increases and this stimulates insulin
secretion.  Insulin increases glucose removal into skeletal muscle and the
liver, thereby increasing the body’s glycogen stores.

<p>
In exercise, the important hormone is epinephrine.  It stimulates glucose
uptake by skeletal muscle and glucose release by the liver.  Epinephrine
also stimulates glucagon secretion and inhibits insulin secretion.

Insulin

<p>
Plasma insulin concentration decreases during exercise.

<p>
Insulin secretion is inhibited by epinephrine and falling blood glucose
concentrations.

Glucagon

<p>
Plasma glucagon concentration increases during exercise.

<p>
Glucagon secretion is stimulated by epinephrine and falling blood glucose
concentrations.
