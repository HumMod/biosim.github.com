Epinephrine


Plasma epinephrine concentration increases during aerobic exercise in proportion to the intensity of the exercise.



Anaerobic exercise provokes even greater concentration increases (see Skeletal Muscle Afferent Nerves).  In the curve above, anaerobic metabolism probably contributed to the steep epinephrine increase seen at 200 Watts and above.  Heart rates were 175 to 180 beats per minute at the most strenuous level of exercise.

Plasma epinephrine concentration increases very rapidly at the beginning of exercise.  But when exercise targets a specific workload, epinephrine increases even further, but less rapidly, over time, as shown below.



The workload in this case was 67% of maximum O2 uptake.

The cause of the secondary epinephrine increase was probably increased exertion compensating for fatiguing muscles.  Another possibility is worsening acidosis (see Skeletal Muscle Afferent Nerves).

High norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations may stimulate glucagon secretion (Galbo et. at. 1975).  The glucagon, in turn, would liberate glucose to help fuel the anaerobic metabolism.

Effects

The hemodynamic and metabolic effects of increased epinephrine concentrations begin at concentrations slightly above the normal resting concentration, as shown in the table below (Clutter et. al. 1980).

Chemistry

Epinephrine has a molecular weight of 183.  Its composition is C9H13NO3.

Epinephrine concentration in plasma is typically 40 pG/mL or 0.22 nMol/L (Clutter et. al. 1980, Cryer 1980, Fitzgerald et. al. 1980, Planz and Planz 1979).

Typical adrenal epinephrine secretion is 150 nG/Min.

Units

Common units for endogenous plasma concentration are pG/mL and pMol/L.  To convert pG/mL to pMol/L, multiply by 5.46.
