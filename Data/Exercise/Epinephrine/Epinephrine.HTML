Exercise > Epinephrine

<p>
Plasma epinephrine concentration increases during aerobic exercise
in proportion to the intensity of the exercise.

<p>

<p>
Anaerobic exercise provokes even greater concentration increases
(see Skeletal Muscle Afferent Nerves).  In the curve above,
anaerobic metabolism probably contributed to the steep epinephrine
increase seen at 200 Watts and above.  Heart rates were 175 to 180
beats per minute at the most strenuous level of exercise.

<p>
Plasma epinephrine concentration increases very rapidly at the
beginning of exercise.  But when exercise targets a specific
workload, epinephrine increases even further, but less rapidly,
over time, as shown below.

<p>
The workload in this case was 67% of maximum O2 uptake.

<p>
The cause of the secondary epinephrine increase was probably
increased exertion compensating for fatiguing muscles.  Another
possibility is worsening acidosis (see Skeletal Muscle Afferent
Nerves).

<p>
High norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations may stimulate
glucagon secretion (Galbo et. at. 1975).  The glucagon, in turn,
would liberate glucose to help fuel the anaerobic metabolism.

Effects

<p>The hemodynamic and metabolic effects of increased epinephrine
concentrations begin at concentrations slightly above the normal
resting concentration, as shown in the table below (Clutter et.
al. 1980).

Chemistry

<p>
Epinephrine has a molecular weight of 183.  Its composition is
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>.

<p>
Epinephrine concentration in plasma is typically 40 pG/mL or 0.22
nMol/L (Clutter et. al. 1980, Cryer 1980, Fitzgerald et. al. 1980,
Planz and Planz 1979).

<p>
Typical adrenal epinephrine secretion is 150 nG/Min.

Units

<p>
Common units for endogenous plasma concentration are pG/mL and
pMol/L. To convert pG/mL to pMol/L, multiply by 5.46.
