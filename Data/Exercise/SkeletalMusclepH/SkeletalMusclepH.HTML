<p> Exercise > Skeletal Muscle pH

<p>
Cellular pH in resting skeletal muscle is typically 7.15 (Harmer
et.al. 2000, Sullivan et.al. 1994, Hermansen and Osnes 1972).

<p>
Cellular pH falls in exercise in proportion to the intensity of the
exercise, with increased pCO<sub>2</sub> (see <i>Blood Gases</i>)
and increased lactic acid concentrations (see <i>Lactic Acid</i>)
both contributing to the acidity.

<p>
Exercising to exhaustion decreases skeletal muscle pH to around
6.60 (Harmer et.al. 2000, Sullivan et.al. 1994, Hermansen and Osnes
1972).  The acidity appears to be an important contributor to the
perceived and real exhaustion.

Strong Ion Difference

<p>
Lactate accumulates during exercise, decreasing the strong ion
difference (SID, see <i>Acid-Base Balance</i>).  Decreased strong
ion difference lowers the muscle pH.

<p>
We can use lactate, pH and pCO<sub>2</sub> data to estimate skeletal
muscle strong ion difference.  The equation for pH as a function of
pCO<sub>2</sub> and SID must be solved for two different conditions.

<p class='Indent'>
pH = pK + log (SID / pCO2)

<p>
The pH and lactate data is from Harmer et.al (2000) and the
pCO<sub>2</sub> data is from Sun et.al. (2001).

<p class='Indent'>
7.20 = pK + log (SID / 46)
<br>
6.57 = pK + log ((SID – 26) / 90)

<p>
The calculated strong ion difference is 48 mEq/L.  The calculated
pK is 7.18.

Units

<p>
Analyses of cellular constituents often use tissue samples with the
water removed and report the results in terms of mMol/kG of tissue
dry mass.  Skeletal muscle wet/dry ration is 4.06 (75% water) at rest
and 4.12 (76% water) after exercise (Harmer et.al. 2000, Sullivan
et.al 1994).

<p>
Divide mMol/kG dry by 4.06 or 4.12 to get mMol/L.
