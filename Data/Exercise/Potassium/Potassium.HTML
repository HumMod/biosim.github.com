<p> Exercise > Potassium

<p>
Plasma potassium concentration increases during exercise as
potassium ions exit the working muscle.  The increase in
concentration is proportional to workload, as shown below.

<p>
Efflux appears to hit a maximum rate 2 minutes after the start
of exercise (Juel et. al. 1990).

<p>
After an initial increase, plasma K+ continues to drift upward
in long-term exercise, as shown above.

<p>
The data shown above were collected during upright cycling at 67%
of maximum O2 uptake.

<p>
Increased plasma K+ will stimulate aldosterone secretion (see
<i>Aldosterone</i>).

Chemistry

<p>
The potassium ion has a molecular weight of 39.

<p>
Potassium concentration in plasma is typically 4.4 mEq/L.
