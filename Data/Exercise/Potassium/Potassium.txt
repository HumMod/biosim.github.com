Potassium


Plasma potassium concentration increases during exercise as potassium ions exit the working muscle.  The increase in concentration is proportional to workload, as shown below.



Efflux appears to hit a maximum rate 2 minutes after the start of exercise (Juel et. al. 1990).



After an initial increase, plasma K+ continues to drift upward in long-term exercise, as shown above.

The data shown above were collected during upright cycling at 67% of maximum O2 uptake.

Increased plasma K+ will stimulate aldosterone secretion (see Aldosterone).

Chemistry

The potassium ion has a molecular weight of 39.

Potassium concentration in plasma is typically 4.4 mEq/L.
