<p> Exercise > Lactic Acid

<p>
Working muscle metabolizes large amounts of glucose to pyruvate.  Pyruvate
concentrations rise in the process of pushing the Krebs (citric acid) cycle
toward more oxidative metabolism.  Some of the pyruvate shuttles to lactate
and spills out into the interstitium as lactic acid.  Thus, blood lactic acid
in aerobic exercise is proportional to the intensity of the exercise.

<p>
Exercise at or above the maximum oxygen uptake has a strong anaerobic component.
This produces a surge of lactate that is subsequently metabolized with a time
constant of 22 minutes.  This response is shown below.

Chemistry

<p>
Lactic acid has a molecular weight of 90.  Its composition is
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

Units

<p>
Favored units for plasma concentration of lactic acid are mG/100 mL (or mG %)
and mMol/L.  To convert mG % to mMol/L, multiply by 0.11.
