Aldosterone


Plasma aldosterone concentration increases during exercise in response to adrenal zona glomerulosa stimulation by angiotensin II (see Renin & Angiotensin) and increased plasma K+ (see Potassium).



Concentration increases slowly for two reasons.  First the angiotensin II stimulus increases slowly (see Renin & Angiotensin).  Secondly, the aldosterone response involves increased aldosterone synthesis and this takes some time.

Aldosterone measurements made during short-term exercise (e.g., shown above) will probably not represent steady-state values.

Compare the magnitude of the response shown above with the magnitude shown below.

The data shown below were collected during upright cycling at 67% of maximum O2 uptake.



Chemistry

Aldosterone has a molecular weight of 360.45.  Composition is C21H28O5.

Aldosterone concentration in plasma is typically 12 nG/dL or 330 pMol/L.

Units

Popular units are nG/dL and pMol/L.

To convert nG/dL to pMol/L, multiply by 27.7.
