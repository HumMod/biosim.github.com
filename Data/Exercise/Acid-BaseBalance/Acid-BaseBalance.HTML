<p> Exercise > Acid-Base Balance

<p>
Acidity is described in terms of hydrogen ion concentration ([H+], Mol/L)
and pH units (pH).

<p class='Indent'>
pH = -log ([H+])

<p>
Since the hydrogen ion concentration is typically very small, a more useful
version of the equation above is

<p class='Indent'>
pH = 9 - log ([H+])

<p>
where the units for [H+] are nMol/L.

<p>
Acidity is a function of many factors, but the two most important are the
partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) and the strong ion
difference (SID) (Stewart 1978, Stewart 1983).

<p>
Strong ions are ions that are completely dissociated in solution.  In
plasma, sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) are important strong cations,
while chloride (Cl-), lactate (Lac-) and ketoacids (KA-) are important
strong anions.

<p>
The strong ion difference is the sum of the strong cation concentrations
minus the sum of the strong anion concentrations.  Typical values for
plasma are shown below.

<table class='Indent'>
<tr><td>[Na+] </td><td>+144.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>[K+]  </td><td>+4.4  </td></tr>
<tr><td>[Cl-] </td><td>-107.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Lac-]</td><td>-1.5  </td></tr>
<tr><td>[KA-] </td><td>~0    </td></tr>
<tr><td>--------</td><td>--------</td></tr>
<tr><td>[SID] </td><td>+40.0 </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Chemistry and blood gas for a normal venous blood sample are shown below
(Weinstein et. al. 1991).

<table class='Indent'>
<tr><td>pCO2</td><td>41.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>SID </td><td>39.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>[H+]</td><td>43.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>pH  </td><td>7.36</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Using this blood data in Stewart’s analysis yields

<p class='Indent'>
[H+] = 42.0 * (pCO2 / SID)
<br>
pH = 7.37 + log (SID / pCO2)

<p>
The two most important acid-base factors in exercise are the increased
production of CO2 and increased formation of lactic acid.

<p>
These factors apply to the circulating blood and also to the cells and
interstitium of working muscle.

pH

<p>
Exercise typically leads to an acidosis that is proportional to the
intensity of the exercise.  If metabolism becomes anaerobic, large
amounts of lactic acid accumulate and the pH falls precipitously.
Blood pH as a function of exercise intensity is shown below.

<p>
Note the decrease in venous pH values, as blood on this side of the
circulation takes a double hit from increasing pCO2 (see <i>Blood
Gases</i>) and increasing lactate concentration (see <i>Lactic
Acid</i>).

Carbon Dioxide

<p>
Increased blood pCO<sub>2</sub> causes decreased blood pH.  The data
shown below comes from venous blood collected during exercise.

<p><img src='Acid-BaseBalance-2.png' class='Indent'>

<p>
Arterial pCO<sub>2</sub> is nearly unchanged during aerobic exercise,
rising a bit with mild exercise and falling a bit when more strenuous
exercise and lactic acidosis drive up ventilation. See <i>Blood
Gases</i>.

<p>
Venous pCO<sub>2</sub> is increased in exercise, reflecting the
transport of large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> from working muscle
to lung.  Again, see <i>Blood Gases</i>.

<p><img src="../../../Dot.png">
Lactic Acid

<p>
Blood lactic acid concentration increases a bit with mild exercise,
but the increases really don’t have an important effect on blood pH.

<p>
With more severe exercise, anaerobic metabolism kicks in and lactic
acid pours out of the working muscle into the blood stream (see
<i>Lactic Acid</i>).  In these instances, blood lactic acid
concentration has a significant effect on pH, as the figure below
illustrates.
