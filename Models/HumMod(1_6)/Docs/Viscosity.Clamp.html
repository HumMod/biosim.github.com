<p>Viscosity.Clamp
<p>Overview
<p>The clamp feature enables the model user to fix a particular<br>variable at a set value. In the case of viscosity,<br>if the clamp is set to TRUE then viscosity would stay fixed at<br>the initial level. If the clamp is set to FALSE, then viscosity<br>will change as defined by the relationship of hematocrit to <br>viscosity.
<p>Physical Units
<p>The viscosity of normal blood is about 3 times as great<br>as the viscosity of water.
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Viscosity at a normal hematocrit of 0.44 is expressed as 1<br><br>Relationship of hematocrit to viscosity is described in <br>the following references:<br><br>Fan FC, Chen RY, Schuessler GB and Chien S.
