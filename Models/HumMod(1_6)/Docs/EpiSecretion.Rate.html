<p>EpiSecretion.Rate
<p>Definition
<p>Epinephrine secretion rate is calculated from the <br>base rate of secretion * Adrenal nerve effect. Additionally, <br>since control of secretion is a function of membrane transport, <br>the effect of ph, protein, fuel and temperature are important <br>factors. These are classified as other tissue-function and act <br>as a multiplier effect. Under normal physiological conditions, <br>they have a value of 1.0.
<p>Overview
<p>Epinephrine is secreted by the chromaffin cells of the <br>adrenal medulla in response to sympathetic stimulation.<br>Increases in adrenal nerve activity result in an increase<br>in secretion. <br><br>Effects of adrenal nerve activity on epinephrine secretion:<br><br>Data from dogs<br>Takeuchi A, Kimura T, Satoh T.
