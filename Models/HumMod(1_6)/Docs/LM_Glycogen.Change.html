<p>Overview
<p>After absorption into a cell, glucose can be used immediately for<br>release of energy to the cell, or it can be stored in the form of<br>glycogen, a large polymer of glucose. Liver cells and skeletal<br>muscle cells can store large amounts of glycogen. The glycogen <br>molecules can be polymerized to almost any molecular weight and <br>most of the glycogen precipitates in the form of solid granules.<br><br>The process of glycogen formation is called glycogenesis.<br><br>The process of glycogen breakdown is called glycogenolysis. <br><br>The factors that control glycogen synthesis are insulin, blood <br>glucose and the size of the glycogen pool. <br><br>Kruszynska YT.

<p>Defintion
<p>Changes in the glycogen mass are a function of both gains and<br>losses in glycogen integrated over time.
