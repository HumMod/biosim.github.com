<p>Overview
<p>The carotid sinus is a region located on the wall <br>of each internal carotid artery slightly above the<br>the carotid bifurcation of the carotid artery. <br>It contains abundant pressure receptors called <br>baroreceptors. These baroreceptors are spray-type <br>nerve endings that are stimulated when stretched. <br>Signals are transmitted from each each carotid sinus <br>through very small Hering's nerve to the glossopharyngeal <br>nerve and then to the tractus solitarius in the medullary <br>area of the brain stem. The baroreceptors respond <br>extremely rapidly to changes in arterial pressure. <br>Excitation reflexly causes the arterial pressure to <br>decrease by decreasing both peripheral resistance and <br>cardiac output. <br><br>The switch feature enables the model user to disable <br>the carotid sinus reflex. When the switch is off, <br>carotid artery pressure is equal to arterial pressure <br>and the reflex is functional. When the switch is on, <br>the carotid artery pressure is equal to a fixed perfusion <br>pressure defined by the user. <br><br>Angel-Davis J, Daly M de B.
