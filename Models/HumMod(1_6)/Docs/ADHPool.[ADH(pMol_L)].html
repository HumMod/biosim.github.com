<p>ADHPool.[ADH(pMol/L)]
<p>Overview
<p>Antidiuretic hormone(also known as vasopressin or AVP,a nonapeptide, <br>is synthesized in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular<br>and supraoptic nuclei. Its release is stimulated by increased osmolality<br>and by reductions in blood volume and blood pressure. <br>Increased ADH secretion causes increased fluid reabsorption by the<br>kidneys, helping to restore blood pressure and blood volume toward normal. <br><br>When the osmolarity of the body fluids increases above normal,<br>the posterior pituitary gland secretes more ADH, which increases<br>the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water.<br>This allows large amounts of water to be reabsorbed and results <br>in increases in blood volume and decreases in urine volume.<br>An increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity causes special <br>nerve cells called osmoreceptor cells, located in the anterior <br>hypothalamus near the supraoptic nuclei, to shrink. This  shrinkage <br>causes the cells to send nerve signals to the supraoptic nuclei which<br>stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. A second<br>neuronal area important in controlling osmolarity and ADH secretion <br>is located along the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, <br>called the AV3V region. At the upper part of this region is a structure <br>called the subfornical organ, and at the inferior part is another structure <br>called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Between these two <br>organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has multiple nerve connections<br>with the two organs as well as with the supraoptic nuclei and the blood <br>pressure control centers in the medulla of the brain. <br><br>ADH release is also controlled by cardiovascular reflexes in response to<br>decreases in blood pressure and/or blood volume including the arterial<br>baroreceptor reflexes and the cardiopulmonary reflexes. <br><br>The ADH pool is [ADH]*ECFV.  Typical [ADH] is 2.0 pg/ml and ECFV is 15,000ml <br>2.0pG/ml*15,000ml =30,000pG mass or 30nG (AJP 252: R635, 1986)<br> <br>ADH is secreted into this pool by the pituitary and generally cleared from <br>the pool by the liver and the kidneys. Typical ADH secretion is 3.2nG/min.<br><br>With severe hemorrhage and hypotension, it is likely that the clearance of <br>vasopressin from the circulation will be reduced because of decreased blood <br>flow to the kidneys and splanchnic viscera, the organs resposible for the <br>removal of vasopressin from the circulating blood. <br><br>Share L.
