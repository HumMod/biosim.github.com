<p>KPool.InitialMass
<p>Definition
<p>The initial mass is the starting amount of potassium. Since the <br>plasma concentration is 4.4mEq/L (the Target[K+]) and the<br>volume of distribution is the ECFV (15,000mL), then the <br>initial mass or circulating pool is 66.<br><br>Initial Mass = Target[K+]*ECFV.Vol
<p>Overview
<p>Extracellular potassium concentration is closely regulated<br>and is a function of the balance between rates of intake and <br>excretion of potassium. Maintenance of normal potassium<br>balance requires the kidneys to adjust their excretion rapidly <br>and precisely to wide variations in intake.<br><br>Control of potassium distribution between the extracellular <br>and intracellular compartments also plays an important role <br>in potassium homeostasis. Because over 98 percent of the <br>total body potassium is contained in the cells, they can serve <br>as an overflow site for excess extracellular fluid potassium <br>during hyperkalemia or as a source of potassium during <br>hypokalemia. <br><br><br>In HumMOd, potassium is divided into extracellular K (KPool)<br>and cellular K (KCell)   <br><br>Young DB.
