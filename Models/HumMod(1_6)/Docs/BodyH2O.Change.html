<p>Overview
<p>There are several different ways to describe the body's<br>water compartments.Water compartments can initially be <br>divided into two basic types: intracellular (ICFV) and <br>extracellular (ECFV).<br><br>Intracellular compartments are red blood cells and<br>(all other) cells.<br><br>Extracellular compartments are plasma and interstitium.<br><br>The problem with this scheme is that water cannot move<br>freely between plasma and interstitium but it can move<br>freely between interstitium and cell H2O.<br><br>Another way of dividing the body's water compartments <br>is into intravascular and extravascular compartments. <br>The intravascular compartment can be futher subdivided <br>into RBC water and plasma. Extravascular water is also <br>referred to as tissue H2O.<br><br>Changes in body water may occur as result of both<br>internal and external exchanges.Internal exchanges <br>are capillary filtration and lymph flow.External <br>exchanges are many and include absorption<br>from gut, urine, IV drip, transfusion,<br>hemorrhage ...
