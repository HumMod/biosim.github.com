<p>Overview
<p>The viscosity of blood is a measure of its resistance <br>to flow. The greater the viscosity, the less the flow<br>in a blood vessel if all other factors are constant.<br>Conversely the less viscous a fluid is, the greater <br>the flow. The viscosity of normal blood is about three<br>times as great as the viscosity of water and is largely <br>the result of the large numbers of suspended red cells<br>in the blood. Each of these cells exerts frictional <br>drag against adjacent cells and against the wall of the<br>blood vessel. The percentage of the blood that is cells<br>is called the hematocrit. The viscosity of blood increases<br>dramatically as the hematocrit increases. When the <br>hematocrit rises to 60 or 70 whcih it often does in <br>polycythemia, the blood viscosity can become as great as <br>ten times that of water, and its flow through blood vessels<br>is greatly retarded. <br><br>Relationship of hematocrit to viscosity is described in <br>the following references:<br><br>Fan FC, Chen RY, Schuessler GB and Chien S.
