<p>NESecretion.Spillover
<p>Overview
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released <br>from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons. <br>Norepinephrine is also released from the adrenal medullae <br>in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Increases <br>in adrenal nerve activity cause increases in the release<br>of NE from both nerve endings and from the adrenal medullae.<br>Under resting conditions, only a few percent of the NE <br>entering the plasma represents adrenal medullary secretion. <br>The remainder has its source in the neurotransmitter released <br>by sympathetic nerve varicosities. This NE is referred to <br>as spillover. Total body spillover can be measured using a <br>tracer kinetic method based on dilution of [3H]NE by endogenous NE.<br>During stress responses e.g. acute glucodeprivation, the adrenal <br>contribution to plasma NE levels greatly increases.<br><br>In the model, the adrenal nerve effect is quantified as a <br>multiplier of the base secretion. <br><br>Esler M, Jennings G, Lambert G, Meredith I, Horne M, Eisenhofer G.<br>Overflow of catecholeamine neurotransmitters to the circulation:<br>Source, fate and Functions.

In patients with pheochromocytoma, an <br>increase in plasma NE causes symptoms which include <br>hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. <br>These symptoms reflect the effects of norepinephrine <br>on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.
<p>Spillover Overview
<p>Under resting conditions, most of the NE entering the plasma<br>comes from NE released by sympathetic nerve varicosities. <br>This NE is referred to as spillover. Total body spillover <br>can be measured using a tracer kinetic method based on dilution <br>of [3H]NE by endogenous NE. <br><br>Spillover is a function of ganglionic nerve activity. Under <br>initial conditions, post-ganglia nerve activity is 1.5Hz.<br><br>Spillover = Spillover K* GangliaGeneral.NA(Hz) <br><br>Esler M, Jennings G, Lambert G, Meredith I, Horne M, Eisenhofer G.<br>Overflow of catecholeamine neurotransmitters to the circulation:<br>Source, fate and Functions.
