<p>BloodVol.InitialVol
<p>Definition
<p>The InitialVol is the starting blood volume and is defined<br>by Start-GeneralX-Textbook*TextbookVolume.<br><br>The general scaler (X-Textbook) is designed to have a value of<br>1.0 when body size is textbook (male with all traits set to<br>normal). The value is weighted much more to lean tissue mass<br>than fat mass. This is important for blood volume since blood <br>volume is correlated with body weight. This correlation,<br>however, diminishes as the amount of fat mass in the body <br>increases due to the relative paucity of vascularization <br>of adipose tissue. Blood volume is therefore more closely <br>related to lean body mass than actual weight. <br><br>Sjostrand T.
