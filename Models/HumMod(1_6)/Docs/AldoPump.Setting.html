<p>AldoPump.Setting
<p>Overview
<p>The Aldo Pump enables the model user to change aldosterone<br>levels by infusing aldosterone at different rates. The model <br>user first turns the switch on to activate the pump and then <br>sets the rate of infusion.<br><br>Data is taken from a variety of human and animal studies<br>relating infusion rates to plasma concentrations of aldosterone.<br><br>WF Ganong, PJ Mulrow.

<p>Physical Units
<p>Aldo concentrations have been expressed in nG/100ml<br>and pMol/L. <br>1pMol = 360.4pG = 0.3604nG<br>1pMol/L = 0.36nG/L = 0.036nG/100ml<br>1nG/100mL = 27.75pMol/L<br>12 nG/100mL = 333pMol/L
<p>Concentration Units
<p>A typical [Aldo]concentration is 330pMol/L or 12nG/dL.<br>Molecular weight of aldosterone is 360.45. <br>Thus 1 pMol = 360.45 pG.<br><br>The Merck Index. 12th Edition 1996
