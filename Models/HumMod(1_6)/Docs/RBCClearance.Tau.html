<p>RBCClearance.Tau
<p>Definition
<p>Tau = 120 days
<p>Overview
<p>RBCs normally circulate an average of 120 days <br>before being destroyed. As the cells age, the <br>cell membrane becomes more fragile and the cells <br>rupture during passage through some tight spots <br>in the circulation, particularly in the spleen.<br><br>RBCs are comprised of solids and water. <br>Typical RBC volume is 2400mL with 1580mL <br>being water and 820mL being solids.
<p>Physical Units
<p>Mass mL<br>Flux mL/min<br>RBCvolume mL
<p>Concentration Units
<p>RBC concentrations have been expressed number per <br>cubic millimeter and as a % of the blood volume <br>(hematocrit).<br><br>A typical hematocrit is 44% for males and 40% for females<br><br>A typical concentration is 5,200,000 (plus or minus 300,000)in <br>males and 4,700,000 (plus or minus 300,000) in females<br><br>A typical RBC secretion and clearance rate is 0.014mL/min
