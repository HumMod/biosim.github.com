<p>HgbConc.[Free]
<p>Definition
<p>[Free] is the concentration of hemoglobin available<br>for binding to oxygen. Under normal physiological<br>conditions, [Free] is equal to [Total]. HumMod, however,<br>is set up to allow the model user to control the content <br>of inspired air. (This is achieved by switching<br>on the gas tanks and altering the gas content of the <br>inspired air). In this way, it is possible to add <br>carbon monoxide to the air supply. Since carbon monoxide <br>combines with hemoglobin at the same point on the <br>hemoglobin molecule as does oxygen, it can displace <br>oxygen from the hemoglobin, thereby decreasing the oxygen<br>carrying capacity of the blood. The affinity of hemoglobin<br>for CO is 230 times its affinity for oxygen.<br><br>[Free] = [Total] - [Carboxy]<br><br>where[Carboxy] is the amount of hemoglobin bound to <br>carbon monoxide. Under normal physiological conditions,<br>[Carboxy] = 0 and [Free] = [Total].<br><br>Allen TA, Root WS. Partition of carbon monoxide and oxygen<br>between air and whole blood of rats, dogs and men as <br>affected by pH. J Appl Physiol 10: 186 - 190, 1957.
