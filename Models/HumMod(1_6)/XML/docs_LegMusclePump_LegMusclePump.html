&lt;label&gt; Overview &lt;/label&gt;<br>

<br>
Intermittent muscular movement causes a pumping action <br>
in the veins which is called the muscle pump. Each time <br>
a vein is compressed, blood flows out of the compressed <br>
segment towards the heart. Venous valves force the blood <br>
in the direction of the heart and this pumping action <br>
maintains venous pressure at a much lower level than would <br>
occur in a standing motionless adult. It also prevents the <br>
veins from pooling large volumes of blood. <br>
<br>
The valves of the venous system frequently become incompetent <br>
or sometimes are even destroyed. When this occurs, the pressure <br>
in the veins of the legs greatly increases because of failure <br>
of the venous pump; this further increases the sizes of the <br>
veins and finally destroys the function of the valves completely <br>
leading to the development of varicose veins.<br>
<br>
Whenever people with varicose veins stand for more than a few <br>
minutes, the venous and capillary pressures become very high, <br>
and leakage of fluid from the capillaries causes constant edema<br>
in the legs.<br>
