<p>
2012-02-12. Expanded the Lifestyle menu Diet to include
Hunger | Thirst and Control. Temperature of ingested food
and water may now be specified.

<p>
2012-02-12. Bumped version number to 2.0.9.

<p>
2012-02-11. Replaced the numerical methods in the pulmonary
circulation with a better way to do the hemodynbamics. I like
the results.

<p>
2012-02-11. Rescaled initial plasma protein to get an initial
COP of 28 mmHg. COP was starting at 26, which caused some
plasma leak into the IFV. Then scaled interstitial protein
for the first time to get an initial COP of around 8 mmHg.

<p>
2012-02-11.Added an Energy section, with Energy-Stores and
Energy-Tools structures. The first idea here is to calculated
and display total energy stored in the body, including lipid
and glycogen. Panel is visible as Energy Stores on the
Metabolism menu.

<p>
2012-02-11. Bumped version to 2.0.8.

<p>
2012-02-10. VascularCompartments keep their name in structures,
but are displayed under Circulation as Blood Vessels. Then in
the Blood Vessels menu, there is a Great Veins menu selection.
It shows panels for Superior Vena Cava, Coronary Sinus and
Inferior Vena cava.

<p>
2012-02-10. Revised Circulation | OrganFlow to prepare for
a superior and inferior vena cava. Right and left hearts now
drain into the right atrium through the coronary sinus, as
recommended by Marek.

<p>
2012-02-10. Bumped version to 2.0.7.

<p>
2012-02-09. Fixed middle and lower torso water problem as
reported by both Marek and Radu.

<p>
2012-02-09. Add lots of new pages to the Normal Values Web
site.

<p>
2012-02-08.Adding spreadsheet sheets and Web pages to Normal
Values in HumModRepository. 

<p>
2012-02-08. Cleaned up the layout in respiratory muscle size.
There was groupbox overlap.

<p>
2012-02-06. The idea right now is to put a lot of function
into a spreadsheet so that model scaling becomes algorithmic.
So far, so good. Added the basic building blocks like organ
mass and organ blood flow. The tougher stuff will come
later.

<p>
2012-02-05. Redesigned the Normal Values section of the
HumModRepository and started adding pages.

<br> General - Organ Mass
<br> General - Gender
<br> General - Blood Pressures
<br> General - Blood Flow

<p>
2012-02-04. Added major new section to HumModRepository titled
Normal Values with subsections Male 37 Years and Female 37 Years.

<p>
2012-02-04. Bumped version number to 2.0.6.

<p>
2012-02-03. Increased the initial CO2 mass in the brain a little
to get a better starting brain pH.

<p>
2012-02-03. Changed the name of BloodPh structure to BloodPhValues. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Add groupbox that announces gender at gender specific
organs : ovaries, uterus, testes. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Removed stimulators menu item and panel from Intervention.
Model had a couple of neural stimulators but I'm switching to clamps
to have consistency across the model.

<p>
2012-02-03. In menus and panels, RHPumping goes to RightHeartPumping,
LHPumping goes to LeftHeartPumping and Contractility goes to
HeartStrength. Left Heart and Right Heart Heart Strength, Contractile
Protein and Work get group boxes  -- in one case to separate
radiobuttons and in all cases to improve the look.

<p>
2012-02-03. Arterial hemorrhage can now be fixed rate or pressure
driven. Panel is under Trauma.

<p>
2012-02-03. Bumped version number to 2.0.5.


<p>
2012-02-02. Modeled coronary sinus. Variables are 

<p>
2012-02-02. Added posture energy. The code is in PostureEnergy.
The panel is under Miscellaneous | Orthostasis.

<p>
2012-02-02. Added heart mechanoreceptors code and panels at
autonomics afferents and autonomics CNS. Tidied up vagus nerve.

<p>
2012-02-02. Bumped version number to 2.0.4.

<p>
2012-02-01. Removed SequesteredBV from the Nerves | Autonomics |
Efferents menu. Installed Alpha Receptors menu item at Miscellaneous 
Orthostatics | Sequestered Blood. Added a panel. Edited sequestered
blood in arteries and veins to show effect of alpha agonist on
pressure-volume relationship.

<p>
2012-02-01. Renamed the SympsChemo structure to ChemoreceptorsCNS.
Then wrote the code and panel for the CNS processing of
chemoreceptor afferent nerve activity.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for Cushing response.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for CNS trophic factor.

<p>
2012-02-01. Bumped version number to 2.0.3.

<p>
2012-01-31. Edited code, added panels and boxes for afferent
autonomic nerves and central integration of the metaboreflex.
Also fleshed out its effect on the respiratory center.

<p>
Completing and redoing chemoreceptors.

<p>
2012-01-31. Bumped version number to 2.0.2.

<p>
2012-01-30. Added a data set to the HumModRepository. It
is visible at Data | Acid-Base | Ketoacidosis.

<p>
2012-01-29. Two structures were added under Structures \
Morphology. They are Volume.DES and Density.DES. These
structures calculate the volume and the density of the
body.

<p>
Then Display\Diagnosis was edited to replace Morphology
menu item with a Size menu. The Size panels show morphology,
body mass, body volume and body density in detail.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added group boxes and tidied up panels for

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\CRF\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\PTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Vitamin D\... 4 Panels.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Pancreas. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Pancreas.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Adrenal Gland. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Adrenal Gland.

<p>
2012-01-29. Bumped HumMod XML version number to 2.0.1. Plan to
bump daily now with all of the edits going in.

<p>
2012-01-28. With the Win32 library (HumMod.EXE), the programmer
must group the radiobuttons into functional groups. With C# and
WinForms, all of the radiobuttons with the same parent are
considered to be in the same group. I had some panels with more
than one group of radiobuttons on the surface. Parenthood was
clarified by putting groups of buttons in appropriate group
boxes. Panels that were edited :

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\ACTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Calcitonin\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<p>
More panel edits to follow.

<p>
2012-01-28. Installed placeholder folders and files for adrenal
gland and pancreas. Organ weights are visible at <i>Organs</i>
| <i>More</i>. Folders and files created :

<p class='Indent'>
Structure\AdrenalGland\...

<p>
2012-01-28. Thanks to Drew Pruett for this fix. And also Marek. Renin
flux between free renin and granules had derivative signs reversed,
which violated conservation of mass and caused big problems in many
simulations after time had advanced about a week. Files edited :

2012-01-27. To get solution control and display information from
the model solver, the model controller sends a <i>requestcontrollerinfo/</i>
empty message. The controller has a response that was prepared during
model parsing and replies with a <i>controllerinfo</i> ...
<i>/controllerinfo</i> message wrapped around the info.

<p>
2012-01-27. You can edit the content for the <i>hidewindow</i>
element below to <i>True</i> to hide the model solver's main
window. Generally, Windows won't let you hide an application's
main window, but you can minimize and not show it in the task
bar to make it completely disappear.

<p class='Indent'>
WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized ;

<br>
ShowInTaskbar = false ;

<p>
If there is a messup, use the task manager to mop up. Note that the
only way to get the window back is to edit the INI file back to
<i>False</i>.

<p>
2012-01-27. The model solver uses an INI file in place of Windows
registry.

<code>
<P>&lt;ini&gt;
  <p class='Indent'> &lt;windowtop&gt; 136 &lt;/windowtop&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowleft&gt; 776 &lt;/windowleft&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowhigh&gt; 174 &lt;/windowhigh&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowwide&gt; 341 &lt;/windowwide&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowstate&gt; 0 &lt;/windowstate&gt;
  <br> &lt;pipeinterval&gt; 200 &lt;/pipeinterval&gt;
  <br> &lt;hidewindow&gt; False &lt;/hidewindow&gt;
<p>&lt;/ini&gt;
</code>

<p>
2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea might be to specify the model solver and model using
the model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

<p>
<img src='DialogShowingSolverAndModel.PNG'>

<p>
The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br>
Model : HumMod.DES

<p>
2012-01-27. The Model Solver now parses the entire model and tucks
information that might be needed by the model controller into a cache.

<p>
2012-01-27. The development and use of Builder and BuilderXML has been
discontinued. Repository content has been moved to the Archives repo and
the Builder and BuilderXML repo's have been deleted.

<p>
2012-01-26. I created separate documentation sections in HumModRepository
for HumMod(1_6) release and HumMod(2_0) being developed.

<br>
<img src='ReleaseVersions.PNG'>

<p>
2012-01-19. Created this log to record the edits applied to HumMod's XML
files. T.C.
