<p>
2012-03-10. 

<p>
2012-03-09. The next step is a total renovation of
the way context scales initial values.  

<p>
2012-03-09. HumMod's folder organization so far has
been to keep context stuff in a separate folder up
at the level of sturcture, control and display. But
really, context stuff is all structure -- so I made
it a subfolder under Structure. Deleted benchmarks.
Bumped version number to 2.0.15.

<p>
2012-03-09. Two script names (presumably primary and
sandbox) can now be specified and toggled. Visible at
Advanced | Startup. Version to 1.1.2. 

<p>
2012-03-09. Validator wants to run a predetermined script
at startup using information stored in the registry. But
if you don't want this, hold down the control key when
launching.

<p>
2012-03-09. The InteractiveController would not update an
open panel after the user did something on another panel
and then came to the former. Fixed. Bumped version to 1.1.4.

<p>
2012-03-07. Stripped all of the dead code out of Validator
and started routine use. There is no documentation but
there are plenty of scripts in the repository. v1.1.1.

<p>
2012-03-07. Totally rewrote Validator to simplify schema,
increase flexibility and improve internal structure.
Bumped version number to 1.1.0.

<p>
2012-03-06. Bumped version number to 1.0.2. Edited a type in
tabbed dialog Status.

<p>
2012-03-05. Working on some improvements to Validator. Bump
version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-03-04. Validator is a simulation utility that parses and
executes scripts that control solutions. Validator collects
measures of prediction accuracy and emits this information as
Web pages in the HumMod Repository. Version 1.0.0 has just
been pushed.

<p>
Sub-folder organization is significant. Each sub-folder contains
one script named Script.Script. Validator takes this script and
emits an HTML version of it. Validator then executes the script
and emits the results as HTML into Results.HTML in the same
subfolder.

<p>
So after Validator has been run, each sub-folder contains three
files.

<p> # Script.Script (by the scipt author)
<br> # Script.HTML (by Validator)
<br> # Results.HTML (by Validator)

<p>
Some early results can be seen in the HumMod Repository
under Validation.

<p>
The Validator bottom line is that Validator takes care of all
of the Web site management. The script writer can focus solely
on creating scripts that accurately evaluate the performance
of the model.

<p>
2012-02-27. Changed the Settings menu item in the ModelSolver
to Advanced and added some tabs. Making some small changes in
ScriptedController as it is used to do validation. Added more
tabs to advanced.

<p>
2012-02-27. Refactored the pipe in both controllers and the
solver. Then bumped version numbers.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.3)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.6)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.5)

<p>
2012-02-26. Added elements to the ScriptedController's scripting
schema to help accumlating, formatting and pasting to the results
log statistics generated by the Accept, Quality and Review tests.
The element names start with stats_. Documentation is in Docs at
ScriptedController\Docs\Schema\Script.

<p>
2012-02-26. Added script_to_html element to ScriptedController's
schema. This element tells the ScriptedController to take all of
the files contributing to the current script and make HTML
formatted copies of the files. Way cool, these copies can be
routed directly and automatically to the HumMod repository Web
site. A site visitor can see both the results of a script and
the script that created the results. Repository curator (currently)
must manually edit an index page for each of results and scripts.

<p>
2012-02-26. Bumped InteractiveController version to 1.1.5 with a
large number of edits underway.

<p>
2012-02-25. Completed implementing the scripted controller's
files element.

<p>
2012-02-25. Added some new elements to the scripted controller's
scripting schema so that statistics may be calculated, accumulated
and displayed on a local, regional or global basis. Will have
some documentation next.

<p>
2012-02-25. Bumped version numbers due to a variety of edits.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.2)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.4)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.4)

<p>
2012-02-25. I modified the pipe a bit to tidy it up. I hope
that I didn't foul it up.

<p>
2012-02-24. Small edits to scripted controller.

<p>
2012-02-24. Interactive controller goes to v1.1.1 with better
implementation of the action button. Build date is now shown
in the dialog box. Model title now comes across from the model
solver in the large controllerinfo message. The title is then
added to controller's title bar (at the top of the main window).

<p>
2012-02-24. Model solver now treats action button as a top-level
asynchronous event. Responds with two new messages : actionbuttondone
and actionbuttonfailed. Version 1.0.3.

<p>
2012-02-23. All of the basic formatting code is in place in
ScriptedController and it is ready for use. But a large
amount of further refinement is forthcoming

<p>
2012-02-23. Fixed ActionButton problem. The problem was in
the ModelSolver which thought that an action button message
was actually an action button display element. Thanks Drew.

<p>
2012-02-23. Bumped version to v1.1.3. Refactored file I/O. 

<p>
2012-02-22. ScriptedController edits are moving right along.

<p>
2012-02-22. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.2 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-22. Expanded the HumModRepository to store and display the
scripts used in model validation.

<p>
2012-02-21. Well into final part of this redo, which is implementing
the emit element. Emit lets a script specify the results log
formatting as: TEXT, XML, or HTML.

<p>
2012-02-21. Cleaned up code that handles a missing startup script
(named in command line or registry).

<p>
2012-02-21. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.1 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-20. There may have been a long standing error in getting
startup script names out of the registry. Startup code has been
refactored. Looks and works good.

<p>
2012-02-20. New scripting elements have been added to schema and
to code. Documentation is up to date in Docs | Schema | Script. 

<p>
2012-02-20. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.0. A major remake
is underway.

<p>
2012-02-20. Added three elements to the Scripted Controller's
scripting schema (no coding yet, just documentation). These
elements should be useful when we are routing Scripted
Controller output directly to a Web site.

<p>
The new elements are

<p>&lt;parent&gt; ... &lt;/parent&gt;
<br>&lt;homepath&gt; ... &lt;/homepath&gt;
<br>&lt;breadcrumbs&gt; ... &lt;/breadcrumbs&gt;

<p>
2012-02-20. Roughed out the model validation section in
the HumMod Repository. Try Validation | HumMod(v2.0) |
Initial Values ... 

<p>
2012-02-19. Following Marek's suggestion, renal efferent
blood flow was broken down into some of its component
parts. Details are visible at Organs | Kidney | Vascular
Segments | Efferent Artery. 

<p>
2012-02-19. Added vascular conductance on a /G basis to :
right heart, left heart, hepatic artery, hepatic vein,
kidney.

<p>
2012-02-19. Bumped version to 2.0.13.

<p>
2012-02-18. Putting in all vascular conductance as a /G
function of organ weight (ie scaled). About 1/2 done.

<p>
2012-02-18. I didn't have lactate metabolism quite right,
and after two weeks the lactate mass in the kidney went to
zero triggering a divide by zero in the fuel selector. I
think that this is fixed with improved physiology actually.

<p>
2012-02-18. Bumped version to 2.0.12.

<p>
2012-02-17. Marek pointed out that I was cutting corners on
this calculation by assuming a pulse pressure in the stroke
volume calculation (using the Suga-Sagawa heart model). The
rigorous calculation is now in place, using an implicit
algebraic equation. SBP in aorta and pulmonary artery is
defined by the implicit. Stoke volume is calculated and used
to calculate the end value of SBP. The calculation crosses
several structures, but it should be a very benign calculation.

<p>
2012-02-17. Values for left and right side stenosis and regurg
are now in groupboxes in the left and right heart pumping
panels.

<p>
2012-02-17. Code and panels are now installed in all 12 major
organs for the new fuel selector.

<p>
2012-02-16. Starting a data section in HumMod repository for
dietary sodium intake. Will use this data later for model
validation.

<p>
2012-02-15. Modified the Model Solver so that it can return
the model's title when requested. The Scripted Controller can
use this information when doing validations. The incoming
message is &lt;requesttitle/&gt; and the outgoing message is
&lt;title&gt; Title &lt;/title&gt;.

<p>
The title contains the model's version number.

<p>
Bumped the Model Solver's version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-02-14. I created a new, way cool fuel selector. It is
initially installed in other tissues.

<p>
2012-02-14. There is now water vapor in inspired air. The
calculation is based on relative humidity. There is also a
water vapor gas tank. Air is humidified in the bronchi
(added groupbox) and insensible loss is calculated using
the amount of H2O added. This advance was suggested by
Drew. 

<p>
2012-02-14. Bumped version to 2.0.11.

<p>
2012-02-13. The big increase in arterial pO2 at the start of
exercise is gone, probably because cardiac output is increasing
more accurately.

<p>
2012-02-13. CO2 balance is now calculated in detail, including
renal bicarb excretion (suggested by Marek). Results are
displayed in a panel at Respiration | CO2 | Balance.

<p>
2012-02-13. Hunger is now a function of [Glucose] and
[Leptin].

<p>
2012-02-13. Redid mass balance and thermodynamics in GI
lumen.

<p>
2012-02-13. Bumped version to 2.0.10.

<p>
2012-02-12. Expanded the Lifestyle menu Diet to include
Hunger | Thirst and Control. Temperature of ingested food
and water may now be specified.

<p>
2012-02-12. Bumped version number to 2.0.9.

<p>
2012-02-11. Replaced the numerical methods in the pulmonary
circulation with a better way to do the hemodynbamics. I like
the results.

<p>
2012-02-11. Rescaled initial plasma protein to get an initial
COP of 28 mmHg. COP was starting at 26, which caused some
plasma leak into the IFV. Then scaled interstitial protein
for the first time to get an initial COP of around 8 mmHg.

<p>
2012-02-11.Added an Energy section, with Energy-Stores and
Energy-Tools structures. The first idea here is to calculated
and display total energy stored in the body, including lipid
and glycogen. Panel is visible as Energy Stores on the
Metabolism menu.

<p>
2012-02-11. Bumped version to 2.0.8.

<p>
2012-02-10. VascularCompartments keep their name in structures,
but are displayed under Circulation as Blood Vessels. Then in
the Blood Vessels menu, there is a Great Veins menu selection.
It shows panels for Superior Vena Cava, Coronary Sinus and
Inferior Vena cava.

<p>
2012-02-10. Revised Circulation | OrganFlow to prepare for
a superior and inferior vena cava. Right and left hearts now
drain into the right atrium through the coronary sinus, as
recommended by Marek.

<p>
2012-02-10. Bumped version to 2.0.7.

<p>
2012-02-09. Fixed middle and lower torso water problem as
reported by both Marek and Radu.

<p>
2012-02-09. Add lots of new pages to the Normal Values Web
site.

<p>
2012-02-08.Adding spreadsheet sheets and Web pages to Normal
Values in HumModRepository. 

<p>
2012-02-08. Cleaned up the layout in respiratory muscle size.
There was groupbox overlap.

<p>
2012-02-06. The idea right now is to put a lot of function
into a spreadsheet so that model scaling becomes algorithmic.
So far, so good. Added the basic building blocks like organ
mass and organ blood flow. The tougher stuff will come
later.

<p>
2012-02-05. Redesigned the Normal Values section of the
HumModRepository and started adding pages.

<br> General - Organ Mass
<br> General - Gender
<br> General - Blood Pressures
<br> General - Blood Flow

<p>
2012-02-04. Added major new section to HumModRepository titled
Normal Values with subsections Male 37 Years and Female 37 Years.

<p>
2012-02-04. Bumped version number to 2.0.6.

<p>
2012-02-03. Increased the initial CO2 mass in the brain a little
to get a better starting brain pH.

<p>
2012-02-03. Changed the name of BloodPh structure to BloodPhValues. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Add groupbox that announces gender at gender specific
organs : ovaries, uterus, testes. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Removed stimulators menu item and panel from Intervention.
Model had a couple of neural stimulators but I'm switching to clamps
to have consistency across the model.

<p>
2012-02-03. In menus and panels, RHPumping goes to RightHeartPumping,
LHPumping goes to LeftHeartPumping and Contractility goes to
HeartStrength. Left Heart and Right Heart Heart Strength, Contractile
Protein and Work get group boxes  -- in one case to separate
radiobuttons and in all cases to improve the look.

<p>
2012-02-03. Arterial hemorrhage can now be fixed rate or pressure
driven. Panel is under Trauma.

<p>
2012-02-03. Bumped version number to 2.0.5.


<p>
2012-02-02. Modeled coronary sinus. Variables are 

<p>
2012-02-02. Added posture energy. The code is in PostureEnergy.
The panel is under Miscellaneous | Orthostasis.

<p>
2012-02-02. Added heart mechanoreceptors code and panels at
autonomics afferents and autonomics CNS. Tidied up vagus nerve.

<p>
2012-02-02. Bumped version number to 2.0.4.

<p>
2012-02-01. Removed SequesteredBV from the Nerves | Autonomics |
Efferents menu. Installed Alpha Receptors menu item at Miscellaneous 
Orthostatics | Sequestered Blood. Added a panel. Edited sequestered
blood in arteries and veins to show effect of alpha agonist on
pressure-volume relationship.

<p>
2012-02-01. Renamed the SympsChemo structure to ChemoreceptorsCNS.
Then wrote the code and panel for the CNS processing of
chemoreceptor afferent nerve activity.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for Cushing response.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for CNS trophic factor.

<p>
2012-02-01. Bumped version number to 2.0.3.

<p>
2012-01-31. Edited code, added panels and boxes for afferent
autonomic nerves and central integration of the metaboreflex.
Also fleshed out its effect on the respiratory center.

<p>
Completing and redoing chemoreceptors.

<p>
2012-01-31. Bumped version number to 2.0.2.

<p>
2012-01-30. Added a data set to the HumModRepository. It
is visible at Data | Acid-Base | Ketoacidosis.

<p>
2012-01-29. Two structures were added under Structures \
Morphology. They are Volume.DES and Density.DES. These
structures calculate the volume and the density of the
body.

<p>
Then Display\Diagnosis was edited to replace Morphology
menu item with a Size menu. The Size panels show morphology,
body mass, body volume and body density in detail.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added group boxes and tidied up panels for

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\CRF\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\PTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Vitamin D\... 4 Panels.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Pancreas. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Pancreas.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Adrenal Gland. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Adrenal Gland.

<p>
2012-01-29. Bumped HumMod XML version number to 2.0.1. Plan to
bump daily now with all of the edits going in.

<p>
2012-01-28. With the Win32 library (HumMod.EXE), the programmer
must group the radiobuttons into functional groups. With C# and
WinForms, all of the radiobuttons with the same parent are
considered to be in the same group. I had some panels with more
than one group of radiobuttons on the surface. Parenthood was
clarified by putting groups of buttons in appropriate group
boxes. Panels that were edited :

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\ACTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Calcitonin\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<p>
More panel edits to follow.

<p>
2012-01-28. Installed placeholder folders and files for adrenal
gland and pancreas. Organ weights are visible at <i>Organs</i>
| <i>More</i>. Folders and files created :

<p class='Indent'>
Structure\AdrenalGland\...

<p>
2012-01-28. Thanks to Drew Pruett for this fix. And also Marek. Renin
flux between free renin and granules had derivative signs reversed,
which violated conservation of mass and caused big problems in many
simulations after time had advanced about a week. Files edited :

<p>
2012-01-27. To get solution control and display information from
the model solver, the model controller sends a <i>requestcontrollerinfo/</i>
empty message. The controller has a response that was prepared during
model parsing and replies with a <i>controllerinfo</i> ...
<i>/controllerinfo</i> message wrapped around the info.

<p>
2012-01-27. You can edit the content for the <i>hidewindow</i>
element below to <i>True</i> to hide the model solver's main
window. Generally, Windows won't let you hide an application's
main window, but you can minimize and not show it in the task
bar to make it completely disappear.

<p class='Indent'>
WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized ;

<br>
ShowInTaskbar = false ;

<p>
If there is a messup, use the task manager to mop up. Note that the
only way to get the window back is to edit the INI file back to
<i>False</i>.

<p>
2012-01-27. The model solver uses an INI file in place of Windows
registry.

<code>
<P>&lt;ini&gt;
  <p class='Indent'> &lt;windowtop&gt; 136 &lt;/windowtop&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowleft&gt; 776 &lt;/windowleft&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowhigh&gt; 174 &lt;/windowhigh&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowwide&gt; 341 &lt;/windowwide&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowstate&gt; 0 &lt;/windowstate&gt;
  <br> &lt;pipeinterval&gt; 200 &lt;/pipeinterval&gt;
  <br> &lt;hidewindow&gt; False &lt;/hidewindow&gt;
<p>&lt;/ini&gt;
</code>

<p>
2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea might be to specify the model solver and model using
the model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

<p>
<img src='DialogShowingSolverAndModel.PNG'>

<p>
The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br>
Model : HumMod.DES

<p>
2012-01-27. The Model Solver now parses the entire model and tucks
information that might be needed by the model controller into a cache.

<p>
2012-01-27. The development and use of Builder and BuilderXML has been
discontinued. Repository content has been moved to the Archives repo and
the Builder and BuilderXML repo's have been deleted.

<p>
2012-01-26. I created separate documentation sections in HumModRepository
for HumMod(1_6) release and HumMod(2_0) being developed.

<br>
<img src='ReleaseVersions.PNG'>

<p>
2012-01-19. Created this log to record the edits applied to HumMod's XML
files. T.C.
