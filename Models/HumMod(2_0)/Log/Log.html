2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea is to specify the model solver and model using the
model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br class='Indent'>
Model : HumMod.DES
