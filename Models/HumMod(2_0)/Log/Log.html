<p>
To get solution control and display information from the model
solver, the model controller sends a requestcontrollerinfo empty
message. The controller has a response that was prepared during
model parsing and replies with a controllerinfo ... /controllerinfo
message wrapped around the info.

<p>
2012-01-27. You can edit the content for the <i>hidewindow</i>
element below to <i>True</i> to hide the model solver's main
window. Generally, Windows won't let you hide an application's
main window, but you can minimize and not show it in the task
bar to make it completely disappear.

<p class='Indent'>
WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized ;

<br>
ShowInTaskbar = false ;

<p>
If there is a messup, use the task manager to mop up. Note that the
only way to get the window back is to edit the INI file back to
<i>False</i>.

<p>
2012-01-27. The model solver uses an INI file in place of Windows
registry.

<code>
<P>&lt;ini&gt;
  <p class='Indent'> &lt;windowtop&gt; 136 &lt;/windowtop&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowleft&gt; 776 &lt;/windowleft&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowhigh&gt; 174 &lt;/windowhigh&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowwide&gt; 341 &lt;/windowwide&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowstate&gt; 0 &lt;/windowstate&gt;
  <br> &lt;pipeinterval&gt; 200 &lt;/pipeinterval&gt;
  <br> &lt;hidewindow&gt; False &lt;/hidewindow&gt;
<p>&lt;/ini&gt;
</code>

<p>
2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea might be to specify the model solver and model using
the model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

<p>
<img src='DialogShowingSolverAndModel.PNG'>

<p>
The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br>
Model : HumMod.DES

<p>
2012-01-27. The Model Solver now parses the entire model and tucks
information that might be needed by the model controller into a cache.

<p>
2012-01-27. The development and use of Builder and BuilderXML has been
discontinued. Repository content has been moved to the Archives repo and
the Builder and BuilderXML repo's have been deleted.

<p>
2012-01-26. I created separate documentation sections in HumModRepository
for HumMod(1_6) release and HumMod(2_0) being developed.

<p>
2012-01-19. Created this log to record the edits applied to HumMod's XML
files. T.C.
