Norepinephrine (C8 H11 N O3) has a molecular<br>
weight of 169. <br>
<br>
Typical plasma concentration of NE is 240pG/mL or <br>
1.42nMol/L (Multiply by 0.00592 to convert pG/mL <br>
to nMol/L)<br>
<br>
Volume of distribution for catechols is ECFV or<br>
15,000mL. Therefore the typical circulating pool<br>
or mass of NE is<br>
<br>
240*15,000 = 3600nG<br>
<br>
Clearance rate is typically is 4.5L/Min or 1080nG/Min<br>
<br>
If the pool is 3600nG and 1080nG is cleared per minute<br>
the total pool is cleared in 3600/1800 = 0.33minutes<br>
K = 1/0.33 = 0.3<br>

&lt;name&gt; Rate Constant Definition &lt;/name&gt;<br>
&lt;label&gt; Rate Constant Definition &lt;/label&gt;<br>
&lt;content&gt;<br>
<br>
Understanding rate constants is an <br>
essential tool for all model builders.<br>
<br>
There is an irrational number called Euler's number <br>
which is often denoted by e (and sometimes exp). <br>
The value of e is roughly 2.718.<br>
<br>
If e is raised to a power, we have an exponential. <br>
A specific example might be e^2. Note that the value <br>
of e to a power can be obtained using an infinite series <br>
(and e to a power is part of every scientific calculator <br>
and computer programming library).<br>
<br>
If we raise e to an unspecified power using a variable, <br>
we have an exponential function. An example might be e^x.<br>
<br>
The exponential function gets attention when is noted <br>
that its derivative with respect to x is again the exponential <br>
function. This can be denoted as<br>
<br>
	d(e^x)/dx = e^x<br>
<br>
The exponential function is also used to (inversely) <br>
define the natural logarithm, denoted by In. If e^x = y <br>
then x = ln y.<br>
<br>
Note that e0 = 1 and e-� = 0. (� represents infinity).<br>
<br>
In models, we often see responses where a variable decays <br>
in an exponential fashion from an initial value to a steady <br>
state value. Such responses can roughly be represented by<br>
<br>
	e^-Kt<br>
<br>
where K is a positive constant called the rate constant and <br>
t is the independent variable (usually time). This function <br>
again has the boundary values of e^K0 = 1 and e^-K� = 0. <br>
(� represents infinity). The importance of K is that it <br>
determines the speed (or rate and hence its name) of transition <br>
between 1 and 0.<br>
<br>
We can now work this backwards and get an estimate of K <br>
by looking at the speed or rate of the decay in an <br>
appropriate data set.<br>
<br>
When t = 1/K, we have e^-1, which has a value of 0.37. <br>
This means that the decay is 63% of way to its final value <br>
(defined as t0.63). So we observe how long it takes the decay <br>
to get to 63% of its final value and then we define K = 1/t0.63.<br>
<br>
Another way to find a rate constant is to <br>
observe how long it takes a decay to get half way to its final <br>
value - this is the half-time. We can denote the half-time <br>
as t1/2. The exponential function is then e^-Kt1/2 = 0.5. <br>
We can solve this equality for K by taking the natural <br>
logarithm of both sides of the equation and rearranging.<br>
<br>
	-Kt1/2 = ln (0.5)<br>
	K = - ln(0.5) / t1/2<br>
<br>
Or simply<br>
<br>
	K = 0.69 / t1/2<br>
<br>
&lt;/content&gt;<br>
&lt;/topicdoc&gt;<br>
