<p>Definition
<p>Base secretion is the rate of secretion from the adrenal <br>medullae when the adrenal nerve effect is 1.0.<br><br>Goldstein DS, Eisenhofer G, Kopin IJ. Sources and significance<br>of plasma levels of catechols and their metabolites in humans.<br>J Pharmacol Exp Ther 305(3): 800-811, 2003.
<p>Overview
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released <br>from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons. <br>Norepinephrine is also released from the adrenal medullae <br>in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Increases <br>in adrenal nerve activity cause increases in the release<br>of NE from both nerve endings and from the adrenal medullae.<br>Under resting conditions, only a few percent of the NE <br>entering the plasma represents adrenal medullary secretion. <br>The remainder has its source in the neurotransmitter released <br>by sympathetic nerve varicosities. This NE is referred to <br>as spillover. Total body spillover can be measured using a <br>tracer kinetic method based on dilution of [3H]NE by endogenous NE.<br>During stress responses e.g. acute glucodeprivation, the adrenal <br>contribution to plasma NE levels greatly increases.<br><br>In the model, the adrenal nerve effect is quantified as a <br>multiplier of the base secretion. <br><br>Esler M, Jennings G, Lambert G, Meredith I, Horne M, Eisenhofer G.<br>Overflow of catecholeamine neurotransmitters to the circulation:<br>Source, fate and Functions.

Sources and significance<br>of plasma levels of catechols and their metabolites in humans.<br>J Pharmacol Exp Ther 305(3): 800-811, 2003.<br><br>NE excites both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and causes<br>a range of different effects in different effector organs <br>depending on the plasma concentration and the density and types <br>of receptors present. In patients with pheochromocytoma, an <br>increase in plasma NE causes symptoms which include <br>hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. <br>These symptoms reflect the effects of norepinephrine <br>on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.
