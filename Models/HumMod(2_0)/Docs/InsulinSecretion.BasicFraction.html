<p>Overview
<p>The primary controller of insulin secretion is plasma<br>glucose concentration. Glucose stimulated insulin <br>secretion in vivo typically follows a biphasic time course; <br>a rapid and transient first phase followed by a sustained <br>second phase. Electrical activity of the beta cell plays <br>a central role in the regulation of insulin secretion. <br>Patch clamp experiments have revealed that two classes of <br>ion channels are particularly important in the generation of <br>beta cell electrical activity: ATP - regulated k+ channels <br>and voltage gated Ca+ channels. When the extracellular glucose <br>concentration is elevated, the rapid uptake of glucose and <br>subsequent metabolic degradation of the sugar results in an <br>elevated cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio. This causes the closure <br>of ATP-regulated K+ channels, membrane depolarization, opening <br>of voltage gated Ca+ channels, an increase in the cytoplasmic <br>calcium concentration and, ultimately, the exocytosis of the <br>insulin-containing secretory granules. This is the first phase.<br><br>Recent studies utilizing both capacitance measurements and <br>electron microscopy of pancreatic beta cells suggests that <br>the secretory granules are divided into two distinct functional <br>pools - a readily releasable pool of granules that is docked <br>at the plasma membrane and can undergo exocytosis immediately <br>when the cell is stimulated, and a reserve pool located in the <br>cytoplasm which is recruited to replenish the readily releasable<br>pool. This correlates well with the biphasic release of <br>insulin seen in healthy individuals. The first phase reflects<br>exocytosis of the readily releasable pool of granules while <br>the second phase is due to release of the reserve pool of <br>granules. Most of the granules (95%) belong to reserve pool<br>and need to be chemically modified to become immediately <br>available for release. The mobilization of the reserve <br>pool granules into the readily releasable pool involves<br>one or several ATP -dependent reactions.<br><br>Rorsman P, Eliasson L, Renstrom E, gromada J, Barg S,<br>Gopel S.
