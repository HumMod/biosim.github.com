<p>ADHSynthesis.Base
<p>Definition
<p>Base synthesis is the level of synthesis under normal<br>physiological conditions.  Initial value is 3.2nG/Min<br>and is equal to initial base secretion.
<p>Overview
<p>Vasopressin (ADH) is synthesized as a precursor prepropeptide, <br>principally in magnocellular neurons whose cell bodies are <br>located in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular <br>nucleus (PVN) of the mammalian hypothalamus. This precursor <br>is packaged into secretory granules and is subject to cleavage <br>and other modifications as it is transported from the cell bodies <br>to storage in the posterior pituitary nerve terminals until its <br>release. The  pituitary gland stores enough vasopressin to maintain <br>basal levels of secretion for up to 30 days or enough to last 5-7 <br>days at maximum release rates. <br><br>In HumMod, the amount of ADH stored in the posterior pituitary <br>is divided into two distict masses - the SlowMass and the FastMass. <br>The Fast Mass is a readily releasable pool of ADH which is released <br>in response to an acute stimulus and does not result in a net <br>increase in synthesis of ADH (as indexed by total mRNA or nucleolar <br>volume in hypothalamic neurons). <br>When a chronic stimulus is applied, sizeable depletion of hormonal <br>stores occurs and a coincidental increase in synthesis occurs. This <br>is the Slow Mass of ADH and is the predominant factor controlling <br>rate of synthesis in the hypothalamus. In HumMod, feedback is a multiplier <br>of base secretion and is dependant on the Slow Mass storage level. <br>As the Slow Mass levels decrease, synthesis increases. <br><br>Although, the ADH pool is theoretically divided into the two distinct <br>masses, there is not a corresponding anatomical distinction. Since <br>vasopressin is synthesized as a precursor prepropepetide and converted <br>to its secreted product within the vesicles, the precise nature of these<br>transformations and their time courses have yet to be elucidated.  <br>   <br>Review<br>North WG.
