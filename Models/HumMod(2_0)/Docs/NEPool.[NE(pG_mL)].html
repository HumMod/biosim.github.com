<p>NEPool.[NE(pG/mL)]
<p>Overview
<p>Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released <br>from axon terminals of sympathetic postganglionic neurons. <br>Norepinephrine is also released from the adrenal medullae <br>in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. <br>Under resting conditions, only a few percent of the NE <br>entering the plasma represents adrenal medullary secretion. <br>The remainder has its source in the neurotransmitter released <br>by sympathetic nerve varicosities. This NE is referred to <br>as spillover. Total body spillover can be measured using a <br>tracer kinetic method based on dilution of [3H]NE by endogenous NE.<br><br>Esler M, Jennings G, Lambert G, Meredith I, Horne M, Eisenhofer G.<br>Overflow of catecholeamine neurotransmitters to the circulation:<br>Source, fate and Functions.

Sources and significance<br>of plasma levels of catechols and their metabolites in humans.<br>J Pharmacol Exp Ther 305(3): 800-811, 2003.<br><br>NE excites both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and causes<br>a range of different effects in different effector organs <br>depending on the plasma concentration and the density and types <br>of receptors present. In patients with pheochromocytoma, an <br>increase in plasma NE causes symptoms which include <br>hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and excess sweating. <br>These symptoms reflect the effects of norepinephrine <br>on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors respectively.
<p>Physical Units
<p>[Plasma]    pG/mL or nMol/L  <br>pG/mL * 0.00592 = nMol/L<br>nMol * 0.1692 = ug<br>Mass nG or pG<br><br>milli = 10^-3<br>micro = 10^-6<br>nano  = 10^-9<br>pico  = 10^-12
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Norepinephrine (C8 H11 N O3) has a molecular<br>weight of 169. Typical plasma concentration of <br>NE is 240pG/mL or 1.42nMol/L (Multiply by 0.00592<br>to convert pG/mL to nMol/L)<br><br>The NE Pool or mass is a function of NE Secretion, <br>NE Clearance and the volume of distribution. <br>Since the volume of distribution for epinephrine is <br>the ECFV (15,000 mL), the typical circulating pool<br>is 3600 nG
