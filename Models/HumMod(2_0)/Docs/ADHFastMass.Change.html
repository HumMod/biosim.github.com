<p>ADHFastMass.Change
<p>Overview
<p>In HumMod, the amount of ADH stored in the posterior pituitary is <br>divided into two distict masses - the SlowMass and the FastMass. <br>This assumption comes from hemorrhage studies in dogs which show <br>that the initial secretory response is not sustained in the <br>presence of a maintained stimulus of hemorrhagic hypotension. <br>The Fast Mass is a readily releasable pool of ADH which is released <br>in response to an acute stimulus and does not result in a net <br>increase in synthesis of ADH (as indexed by total mRNA or nucleolar <br>volume in hypothalamic neurons).<br>The fast mass comprises about 10 -20% of the total hormone content <br>of the gland - 3200nG. Since normal synthesis and secretion rates<br>are 3.2nG/Min into and out of the FastMass pool, the fractional <br>secretion rate is 0.001/min <br><br>Sachs H, Share L, Osinchak J, Carpi A.

<p>Definition
<p>Change in the FastMass pool can occur in three ways: <br>1. ADH secretion depletes the Fast Mass pool <br>2. Flux of ADH out of the FastMass pool into the SlowMass pool<br>also depletes the FastMass pool.<br>3. Flux of ADH out of SlowMass pool into the FastMass pool increases<br>the FastMass pool.   <br><br>Change is therefore defined as <br>ADHSlowMassFlux - ADHFastMass.Flux - ADHSecretion.Rate
