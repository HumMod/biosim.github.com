<p>ADHSlowMass.Change
<p>Overview
<p>In HumMod, the amount of ADH stored in the posterior pituitary is <br>divided into two distict masses - the SlowMass and the FastMass. <br>This assumption comes from hemorrhage studies in dogs which show <br>that the initial secretory response is not sustained in the <br>presence of a maintained stimulus of hemorrhagic hypotension. <br><br>When a chronic stimulus is applied, sizeable depletion of hormonal <br>stores occurs and a coincidental increase in synthesis occurs. This <br>is the Slow Mass of ADH and is the predominant factor controlling <br>rate of synthesis in the hypothalamus. In HumMod, feedback is a multiplier <br>of base secretion and is dependant on the Slow Mass storage level. <br>As the Slow Mass levels decrease, synthesis increases. <br><br>Sachs H, Share L, Osinchak J, Carpi A.

<p>Definition
<p>Change in the SlowMass pool can occur in three ways: <br>1. ADH synthesis increases the Slow Mass pool <br>2. Flux of ADH out of the SlowMass pool into the FastMass pool <br>depletes the FastMass pool.<br>3. Flux of ADH out of FastMass pool into the SlowMass pool increases<br>the SlowMass pool.   <br><br>Change is therefore defined as <br>ADHSynthesis.Rate + ADHFastMass.Flux - ADHSlowMass.Flux
