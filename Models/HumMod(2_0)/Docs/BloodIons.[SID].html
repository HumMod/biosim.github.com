<p>BloodIons.[SID]
<p>Definition
<p>Peter Stewart was a Canadian physiologist who introduced <br>the term "strong ion difference" or [SID] to mean the <br>concentration of strongly dissociating cations minus <br>the concentration of strongly dissociating anions. Strong<br>cations are Na+, K+ and strong anions are Cl- and lactate.  <br><br>The concentrations of anions and cations in both plasma<br>and cells must be equal to maintain electrical neutrality.<br><br>His equation is:<br><br>[SID] + [H+] = [HCO3-] + [A-] + [CO2] + [OH-]<br><br>where [A-] is the concentration of dissociated weak acids.<br><br>In HumMod, SID is calculated from the cations [Na+] and [K+].<br>The anions used are [Cl-], [Lac-]. Additionally the following <br>strong anions are included: Ketoacids [KA-], [SO4--] and [PO--]. <br>Under normal physiological conditions the contribution of the <br>latter three anions is small. <br> <br>Stewart PA.
