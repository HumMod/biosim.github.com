<p>EpiPool.F2
<p>Definition
<p>F2 is a mathematical variable used in the calculation of <br>the mass of Epi. F2 is the loss in Epi over time and is <br>a function of  Epi clearance rate.
<p>Overview
<p>In 1895, Oliver and Schaefer first showed that a substance <br>present in the adrenal gland was pressor. This substance was <br>subsequently shown to be epinephrine.<br><br>Oliver G, Schaefer EA. The physiologic effects of extracts<br>from the suprarenal capsules. J Physiol 18:230-276, 1895<br><br>Barger G, Dale HH. Chemical structure and sympathomimetic<br>action of amines. J Physiol 41:19-59, 1910.<br> <br>Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the adrenal <br>medullae causes release of both epinephrine and <br>norepinephrine into the circulation. Catecholamines <br>exert their effects by stimulating specific protein <br>receptor sites known as adrenergic receptors. There are <br>two types of adrenergic receptors, alpha and beta receptors.<br>Epinephrine excites both types of receptors.<br><br>The epinephrine pool or mass is a function of epinephrine <br>secretion, epinephrine clearance and the volume of distribution<br>which is the ECFV.
<p>Physical Units
<p>[Plasma]  pG/mL or nMol/L<br>Mass  nG or pG<br><br>milli = 10^-3<br>micro = 10^-6<br>nano  = 10^-9<br>pico  = 10^-12
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Epinephrine (C9 H13 N O3) has a molecular weight<br>of 183. Typical plasma concentration is 40pG/mL.<br>or 0.22nMol/L (Multiply by 0.00546 to convert pG/mL<br>to nMol/L).<br><br>Fitzgerald GA, Barnes P, Hamilton CA, Dollery CT<br>Circulating adrenaline and blood pressure: the<br>metabolic effects and kinetics of infused adrenaline<br>in man.
