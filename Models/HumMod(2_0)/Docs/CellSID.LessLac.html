<p>Overview
<p>Peter Stewart was a Canadian physiologist who introduced <br>the term "strong ion difference" or [SID]. SID in any <br>solution is defined as the sum of all the strong cation <br>concentrations minus the sum of all the strong anion <br>concentrations. <br><br>The strong cations in cells are mainly potassium (K+), <br>with small amounts of sodium(Na+) and magnesium (Mg++).<br>Strong anions are phosphate ions and other inorganic ions. <br><br>Stewart's original estimate of of cell SID at 0.130 is <br>rather high.  Experimental evidence suggests a rather <br>low cell SID. This evidence is the pH changes which occur<br>when CO2 and acid microinjection have been used to acidify<br>the cell. Additionally, the pH changes due to lactate<br>generation during exercise support a low cell SID.  <br><br>Stewart PA. Independent and dependent variables of acid-base <br>control.
