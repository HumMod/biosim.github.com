<p>CreatininePool.[Creatinine(mG/dL)]
<p>Definition
<p>[Creatinine] is the plasma concentration of creatinine.<br>It can be expressed as mG/dL or uMol/L
<p>Physical Units
<p>[Plasma]  mG/dL or uMol/L<br>mG * 0.00884 = mMol<br>mMol * 113.1 = mG<br>Mass  mG<br>Clearance mG/min<br><br>milli = 10^-3<br>micro = 10^-6
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Creatinine (C4 H7 N3 O) has a molecular weight<br>of 113.12. <br><br>Typical plasma concentration is 0.82 mG/dL or<br>72.5 uMol/L<br><br>Creatinine excretion is 1.26dL/Min <br><br>Rowe JW, Andres R, Tobin JD, Norris AH, Shock NW.

<p>Overview
<p>Creatinine is formed by nonenzymatic dehydration of <br>creatine and creatine phosphate within striated, <br>smooth and cardiac muscle.<br>Creatine in the body arises from two sources:<br>endogenous synthesis from amino acids and creatine<br>in the diet, notably from the ingestion of meat. <br>Endogenous synthesis occurs primarliy in the kidney <br>but also occurs in the liver. Creatine is concentrated <br>and stored mainly in skeletal muscle. Approximately <br>90% of the body stores of creatine are contained in <br>skeletal muscle. Creatine leaks into the extracellular <br>fluid where it is converted to creatinine. <br><br>Creatinine is excreted both renally and extrarenally. <br>Extrarenal degradation probably occurs in the intestine <br>by intestinal bacteria. Extrarenal excretion is about 1.5% <br>of total excretion and varies with plasma creatinine <br>concentration.<br><br>Borsook H, Bubnoff JW.
