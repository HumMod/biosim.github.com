<p>ADHSecretion.[Osm]Effect
<p>Overview
<p>The osmotic control of ADH release was decisively <br>demonstrated by Verney in 1947. Since then, there<br>have been a number of studies in both humans and <br>experimental animals documenting the relationship <br>between plasma osmolality and plasma vasopressin <br>concentration. An increase in extracellular fluid <br>osmolarity causes special nerve cells called osmoreceptor <br>cells, located in the anterior hypothalamus near the <br>supraoptic nuclei, to shrink. This  shrinkage causes the <br>cells to send nerve signals to the supraoptic nuclei which<br>stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. <br>A second neuronal area important in controlling osmolarity <br>and ADH secretion is located along the anteroventral region <br>of the third ventricle, called the AV3V region. At the upper <br>part of this region is a structure called the subfornical <br>organ, and at the inferior part is another structure <br>called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Between <br>these two organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has <br>multiple nerve connections with the two organs as well as <br>with the supraoptic nuclei and the blood <br>pressure control centers in the medulla of the brain. <br><br>In HumMod, the effect of changes in osmolarity on ADH <br>secretion are expressed as a multiplier of base secretion.<br>The curve relating the osmolarity to ADH secretion is compiled<br>from the studies detailed in the studies listed below. <br>     <br>Historical Data<br>Verney EB.
