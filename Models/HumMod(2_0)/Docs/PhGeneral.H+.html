<p>PhGeneral.H+
<p>AcidBase Overview
<p>Precise regulation of hydrogen ions (H+) in the body<br>is essential because the activities of almost all <br>enzyme systems in the body are influenced by <br>H+ concentration. Therefore changes in hydrogen<br>concentration alter virtually all cell and body <br>functions. <br><br>Blood H+ concentration is normally maintained <br>within tight limits around a normal value of<br>about 0.00004mEq/L (40 nEq/L). Because H+ <br>concentration is low, and these small numbers <br>are cumbersome, it is customary to express<br>H+ concentration on a logarithm scale, using<br>pH units. pH is related to the actual H+<br>concentration by the following formula:<br><br>pH = log 1/[H+] = -log[H+]<br><br>where [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration<br>in Eq/L. <br><br>In HumMod, PhGeneral is a calculator used to<br>provide values for the pH of blood and tissues. <br>PhGeneral calls for values for pK , SID and pCO2<br>which are taken from PhBlood and PhCell. These <br>are used in pHGeneral to calculate pH values which <br>are ultimately returned to BloodPh.
<p>Definition
<p>H+ is the hydrogen ion concentration in Eq/L
