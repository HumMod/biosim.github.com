<p>Adrenergic Receptors
<p>The concept of a receptive mechanism was first introduced <br>by Langley to explain the action of curare on skeletal muscle(1).<br>Dale (2), however, was probably the first to make significant use <br>of the receptor concept in connection with the sympathetic nervous <br>system. Ahlquist in his landmark paper of 1948(3), established two<br>fundamental concepts: first, that a single sympathetic mediator<br>could produce both excitatory and inhibitory responses; and second,<br>that adrenergic receptors were of two different types, alpha and <br>beta receptors, based on rank order potency of activation by agonists.<br>Lands et al.(4) subsequently showed that beta receptors can be<br>subdivided into beta-1 receptors and beta 2 receptors. Alpha <br>receptors can also be subdivided into alpha-1 and alpha-2 depending <br>on the relative potencies of certain alpha agonists and <br>antagonists(5). Currently nine different subtypes of adrenergic <br>receptors have been cloned and pharmacologically catagorized (6).   <br>Therefore the relative effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine <br>on different effector organs are determined by the types of receptors <br>in the organs. Furthermore certain alpha functions are excitatory, <br>whereas others are inhibitory. Likewise certain beta functions are <br>excitatory and others are inhibitory. Therefore, alpha and beta <br>receptors are not necessarly associated with excitation or <br>inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the <br>receptors in the given effector organ<br><br>1.

<p>Definition
<p>The model user can block the effect of beta receptor stimulation.<br>Reeptor blockade is applied at individual organs. Effect is<br>1.0 when there is no blockade. For example,a 16% blockade results <br>in an effect of 0.84.<br>There are a number of drugs known as beta antagonists which can <br>be used clinically to cause beta blockade. These include <br>propranolol and metoprolol.
