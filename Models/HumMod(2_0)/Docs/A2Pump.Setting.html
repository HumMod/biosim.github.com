<p>A2Pump.Setting
<p>Definition
<p>When the A2Pump switch is turned on, the model <br>user can set infusion rates using the sliding bar <br>feature in the A2Pump display box. Infusion rates are <br>on a logarithmic scale. Rates of infusion may be <br>increased from 0, in increments of 10, up to 100; <br>from 100 in increments of 100 up to 1000; and from <br>1000 in increments of 1000, up to 10,000 nG/Min.
<p>Physical Units
<p>[Plasma]  pG/mL; pMol/L<br>Plasma Mass nG
<p>Concentration Units
<p>A typical A2 plasma concentration is 10 pG/ml<br>(recumbent level). <br>To change from pG to pMol multiply by 0.956<br>1.046 pG/mL = 1.0 pMol/L
