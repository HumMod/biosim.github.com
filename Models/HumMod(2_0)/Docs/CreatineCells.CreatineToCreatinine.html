<p>Overview
<p>Creatinine is formed by nonenzymatic dehydration of <br>creatine and creatine phosphate within striated, smooth and <br>cardiac muscle. The rate of creatinine production in normal <br>subjects has been measured and was found to be 1.7% of the<br>creatine pool. <br><br>In HumMod, the creatine pool or mass is the sum of skeletal <br>muscle creatine mass and creatine in smooth & cardiac muscle, <br>collectively known as other mass.<br><br>Crim MC, Calloway DH, Margen S. Creatinine metabolism in men:<br>creatien pool size and turnover in relation to creatine intake.<br>J Nutr 106: 371 - 381, 1975.
