<p>AldoDisposal.Clearance
<p>Overview
<p>Aldosterone is degraded mainly in the liver and <br>conjugated especially to glucuronic acid and, <br>to a lesser extent, sulfates. About 25 per <br>cent of these conjugates are excreted in the bile <br>and then in the feces. The remaining conjugates formed <br>by the liver enter the circulation but are not <br>bound to plasma proteins, are highly soluble in <br>the plasma, and are therefore filtered readily <br>by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. <br><br>Aldosterone disposal is therefore a combination of<br>clearance rate and degradation rate. <br><br>Clearance rate is affected by liver blood flow and by <br>the liver extraction coefficient - the percentage of <br>a substance removed in a single passage through an <br>organ or tissue, in this case the liver. If hepatic <br>blood flow is compromised, plasma levels of aldosterone <br>are markedly increased. Any factor affecting hepatic blood <br>flow will also affect aldosterone disposal. For example, <br>postural changes affect hepatic blood flow and the metabolic <br>clearance of aldosterone in the upright position is half <br>of that in the supine position.    <br><br>Degradation rate is a function of the time constant<br>for degradation and the mass of aldosterone available. <br>Changes in liver function may affect the ability of <br>the organ to degrade aldosterone.

<p>Definition
<p>Clearance is defined as the rate of removal of aldosterone<br>from the circulation in a single passage through the liver. <br>It is dependent on the ExtractK, the liver extraction <br>coefficient and on liver blood flow.
