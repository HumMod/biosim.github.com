<p>AldoSecretion.Rate
<p>Definition
<p>Aldosterone secretion rate is calculated using 6 variables. If the <br>model user sets the clamp "on", then secretion rate is set by<br>the"Level" slide bar. Otherwise rate is calculated using Base Rate,<br>A2Effect, K+Effect and Aldo Tumor secretion. Additionally, since <br>control of secretion is a function of membrane transport, the effect <br>of ph, protein, fuel and temperature are important factors. These are <br>classified as other tissue -function and act as a multiplier effect.<br>Under normal physiological conditions, they have a value of 1.0.
