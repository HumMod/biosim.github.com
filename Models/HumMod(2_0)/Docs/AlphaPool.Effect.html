<p>AlphaPool.Effect
<p>Definition
<p>The alpha pool is the quantity of stimulated alpha receptors.<br>Under resting conditions the effect of alpha pool stimulation<br>is 1.0 and norepinephrine and epinephrine make roughly equal<br>contributions to the alpha pool.
<p>Receptor Dynamics Overview
<p>Besse J, Furchgott R. Dissociation constants and relative <br>efficacies of agonists acting on adrenergic alpha-receptors. <br>Fed Proc 26: 410, 1967<br><br>Clark JW, Leff P. Operational models of pharmacological<br>agonism. Proc R. Soc Lond 220: 141-162, 1983.
<p>Adrenergic Receptors Overview
<p>There are two major types of adrenergic receptors, alpha <br>receptors and beta receptors. Alpha receptors can be subdivided <br>into alpha 1  and alpha 2 receptors. Beta receptors can be <br>subdivided into beta 1 receptors and beta 2 receptors. <br>Norepinephrine and epinephrine have slightly different effects <br>in exciting the alpha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine excites <br>mainly alpha receptors but excites beta receptors to a lesser <br>extent as well. Epinephrine excites both types of receptors <br>approximately equally. Therefore the relative effects of <br>norepinephrine and epinephrine on different effector<br>organs are determined by the types of receptors in the organs.<br>Furthermore certain alpha functions are excitatory, whereas <br>others are inhibitory. Likewise certain beta functions are <br>excitatory and others are inhibitory. Therefore, alpha and beta <br>receptors are not necessarly associated with excitation or <br>inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the <br>receptors in the given effector organ.
