<p>Overview
<p>Valvular lesions can affect the ability of the aortic valve to <br>function. Valvular lesions can occur as a result of rheumatic <br>fever and less frequently as a congenital defect. When the edges <br>of the aortic valve are destroyed so that they cannot close as <br>the ventricles contract, regurgitation or backflow of blood occurs. <br>This results in a decrease in the net stroke volume output of <br>the heart.
