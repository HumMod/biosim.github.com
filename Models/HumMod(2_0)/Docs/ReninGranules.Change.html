<p>Overview
<p>Renin in the kidney resides in two compartments: <br>a free compartment, comprising 10% of the total<br>and  a granule compartment, comprising 90% of <br>the total amount. <br><br>Renin synthesis adds to the free compartment and<br>renin secretion takes from it. There is also a <br>shuttle between the free renin compartment and <br>the granule compartment.   <br><br>Park CS, Malvin RL, Murray RD, Cho KW.
