<p>Overview
<p>Osmolarity is the osmolal concentration of a solution<br>expressed as osmoles (osm) per liter of solution. One <br>osmole  equal to one mole (mol)(6.02 * 10^23) of solute<br>particles. Therefore a solution containing 1 mole of<br>glucose in each liter has a concentration of 1 osm/L.<br>In general, the osmole is too large a unit for expressing<br>osmotic activity of solutes in body fluids. The term <br>milliosmole (mOsm), which equals 1/1000 osmole, is<br>commonly used. <br><br>A normal plasma concentration of glucose is 100mG/dL.<br>100mG/dL = 1000mG/L. The MW of glucose is 180<br>Therefore 100mG/dL = 1000/180 = 5.55 mOsm/L.<br><br>In patients with diabetes, plasma glucose levels can<br>rise to dangerously high levels. This can exert a <br>large amount of osmotic pressure in the extracellular <br>fluid and result in cellular dehydration. Increased <br>excretion of glucose in the urine can also cause osmotic<br>diuresis and a depletion of body fluids. <br><br>Guyton AC, Hall JE. Textbook of medical physiology.<br>Eleventh Edition.
