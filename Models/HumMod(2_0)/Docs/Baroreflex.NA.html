<p>Overview
<p>The baroreceptor reflex has three parts: an afferent <br>part, processing in the central nervous system, and an<br>efferent part. The afferent part of the baroreceptor <br>reflex consists of nerve endings that act as pressure <br>sensors in the arch of the aorta and carotid arteries.<br>Receptors are most concentrated along the carotid artery <br>in a region called the carotid sinus. Increasing pressure <br>is excitatory and signals are transmitted from each <br>carotid sinus through very small Hering's nerves to the <br>glossopharyngeal nerve and then to the tractus solitarius <br>in the medullary area of the brain stem. Signals from the <br>aortic baroreceptors in the arch of the aorta are transmitted <br>through the vagus nerve to the same tractus solitarius of the <br>medulla. The baroreceptors respond extremely rapidly <br>to changes in arterial pressure.<br><br>Angel-Davis J, Daly M de B.
