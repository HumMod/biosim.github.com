<p>BloodVol.Collapsed
<p>Definition
<p>Blood vessels tend to collapse at low volumes. This <br>occurs when the internal pressure in the vessel is <br>equal to or less than the external pressure. This collapse affects <br>conductance and hence venous blood flow. In HumMod, collapsed is <br>a conditional variable used to define the collapsed effect,a multiplier <br>used to calculate systemic venous conductance and hence venous outflow. <br>If blood volume is less than the unstressed volume, then the collapsed<br>effect is true and it's value is BloodVolume/unstressed volume, a <br>value less than 1.0. If blood volume is greater than or equal to <br>the unstressed volume, then collapsed is false and the collapsed <br>effect is 1.0.
