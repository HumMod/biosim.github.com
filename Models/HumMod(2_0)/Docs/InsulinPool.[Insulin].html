<p>Overview
<p>Insulin was first isolated from the pancreas in 1922 by <br>Banting and Best. It is synthesized in and secreted by <br>the beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas <br>and plays an important role in the regulation of glucose, <br>lipid and protein metabolism. Insulin secretion is associated<br>with energy abundance. When there is a great abundance of <br>energy-giving foods in the diet, especially excess amounts <br>of carbohydrates, insulin is secreted in great quantity. <br>In turn, the insulin plays an important role in storing <br>the excess energy. The primary controller of insulin <br>secretion is increased blood glucose concentration. <br>Insulin increases the transport of glucose into liver, <br>muscle and other cells, thereby reducing the blood <br>glucose concentration back towards a normal value. <br>Other factors which stimulate insulin secretion include <br>increased blood amino acids; gastrointestinal hormones <br>including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric <br>inhibitory peptide.<br><br>Guyton AC & Hall JE Textbook of medical physiology. <br>Eleventh Edition.
