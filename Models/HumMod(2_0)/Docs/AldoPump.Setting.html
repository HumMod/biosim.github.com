<p>AldoPump.Setting
<p>Defintion
<p>When the AldoPump switch is turned on, the model <br>user can set infusion rates using the sliding bar <br>feature in the ADH pump display box. Rates of infusion<br>may be increased from 0, in increments of 10, up to <br>4000 pMol/Min.<br><br>Normal adrenal aldosterone secretion rate is 330.0 pMol/Min.
<p>Overview
<p>The AldoPump enables the model user to change <br>[Aldo] levels by infusing aldosterone at different <br>rates. Data is taken from a variety of human and <br>animal studies relating infusion rates to plasma <br>concentrations of Aldosterone<br><br>When the switch is turned on, the model user sets the <br>rate by changing the setting using the slide bar.<br> <br>Dog Data<br>WF Ganong, PJ Mulrow.

<p>Physical Units
<p>Aldo concentrations have been expressed in nG/100ml<br>and pMol/L. <br>1pMol = 360.4pG = 0.3604nG<br>1pMol/L = 0.36nG/L = 0.036nG/100ml<br>1nG/100mL = 27.75pMol/L<br>12 nG/100mL = 333pMol/L
<p>Concentration Units
<p>A typical [Aldo]concentration is 330pMol/L or 12nG/dL.<br>Molecular weight of aldosterone is 360.45. <br>Thus 1 pMol = 360.45 pG.<br><br>The Merck Index. 12th Edition 1996
