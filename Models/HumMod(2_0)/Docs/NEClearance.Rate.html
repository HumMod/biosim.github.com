<p>Overview
<p>Norepinephrine is cleared from plasma mainly in the liver.<br><br>Lund A. Elimination of adrenaline and noradrenaline from <br>the organism. Acta Pharmacol 7: 297, 1951
<p>Physical Units
<p>Clearance is typically expressed in nG/Min or L/Min
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Norepinephrine (C8 H11 N O3) has a molecular<br>weight of 169. <br><br>Typical plasma concentration of NE is 240pG/mL or <br>1.42nMol/L (Multiply by 0.00592 to convert pG/mL <br>to nMol/L)<br><br>Volume of distribution for catechols is ECFV or<br>15,000mL. Therefore the typical circulating pool<br>or mass of NE is<br><br>240*15,000 = 3600nG<br><br>Clearance rate is typically is 4.5L/Min or 1080nG/Min<br><br>If the pool is 3600nG and 1080nG is cleared per minute<br>the total pool is cleared in 3600/1800 = 0.33minutes<br>K = 1/0.33 = 0.3<br><br>Goldstein DS, Eisenhofer G, Kopin IJ.
