<p>CreatineSkeletalMuscle.[Creatine]
<p>Overview
<p>Creatine in the body arises from two sources:<br>endogenous synthesis from amino acids and creatine<br>in the diet, notably from the ingestion of meat. <br>Endogenous synthesis occurs primarily in the kidney<br>but also occurs in the liver. Creatine is concentrated <br>and stored mainly in skeletal muscle where it is used <br>as an energy source, particularly during strenous exercise<br>when oxidative metabolism is too slow to provide sufficient <br>energy. 90% of the body stores of creatine are contained in <br>skeletal muscle. The remaining 10% is contained in smooth <br>and cardiac muscle. Creatine leaks into the extracellular <br>fluid where it is converted to creatinine. <br><br>Creatinine is excreted both renally and extrarenally. <br>Extrarenal degradation probably occurs in the intestine <br>by intestinal bacteria. Extrarenal excretion is about 1.5% <br>of total excretion and varies with plasma creatinine <br>concentration.<br><br>Borsook H, Bubnoff JW.

<p>Definition
<p>[Creatine] is the concentration of creatine in skeletal <br>muscle expressed as mG/G of muscle mass
<p>Physical Units
<p>Units for mass are G<br>Units for [Ceatine] are mG/G
<p>Concentration Units
<p>Skeletal muscle has a creatine concentration of <br>4mG/G Wet Weight. Since skeletal muscle mass is 40% <br>of body weight, skeletal muscle creatine mass is <br>calculated as  4.1 * 27 = 111G.<br><br>Assumptions: Initial body weight = 72KG<br>Muscle Mass = 27.7KG<br><br>Borsook H, Bubnoff JW.
